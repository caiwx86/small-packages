/* The reader's place, on an engine that will not keep it.
 *
 * A poll tick changes the height of things above the reader and the page below moves. Chromium,
 * Firefox and — since WebKit 26 — Safari all hide that with scroll anchoring of their own
 * (docs/anchoring.md, `ENGINE_ANCHORS`); an older WebKit and every iPhone before it had none, and a
 * current one can still get the COLLAPSE case wrong (task wkanchor, and the `tick` row below).
 *
 * The theme does that job where nobody else does (fs-fit.js, ENGINE_ANCHORS). This gate holds every
 * half of that sentence, since each can break silently:
 *
 *   held      with the engine's anchoring suppressed AND the theme's fallback forced on, a growth
 *             above the fold must move the reader by no more than a pixel or two.
 *   floor     the same refill with the correction switched off (`fsAnchor = 'off'`): the content
 *             column holds its height between ticks, so the document never gets short enough to be
 *             clamped. It can only be measured with the other half silent.
 *   swapped   a section refilled the way `dom.content()` refills one — emptied, then filled again —
 *             must leave the reader where they were too, and PROMPTLY: sampled every frame for
 *             `SWAP_WINDOW` (900ms, well past lateDrift()'s measured 419-420ms), a drift that never
 *             falls back under tolerance is one finding ("never came back") and one that does but
 *             past `LATE_MS` (200ms — task latenet's four-way ablation put the theme's own fallback
 *             at 7-36ms and an engine's late residual at 419-420ms, and this sits between the two
 *             with margin either side) is another ("corrected late") — a single fixed-delay read
 *             cannot tell those apart, and used to fold them into the same `moved 0px`. The moment in
 *             between the empty and the refill has no height, and `held` cannot see that: a growth
 *             only ever inserted never collapses anything.
 *   not twice with the engine's anchoring left alone, the same growth must move the reader just as
 *             little — a fallback that also ran there would throw the page the other way.
 *   quiet     while the reader is SCROLLING the theme must not correct at all: a correction landing
 *             inside a flick is itself a jump.
 *   tick      while the reader is PARKED and nothing is inserted, a REAL poll tick — the engine's own
 *             anchoring included — must not move the offset either. `held` closes inside 800ms and
 *             `quiet` discards a still 400ms; a correction landing between those windows (WebKit's
 *             own, measured 421ms) passed both and is what this row exists to catch.
 *   repeat    `swapped` again, `REPEAT_TIMES` (3) times running on the same section — the shape
 *             every case above is structurally blind to: each closes inside one refill, and
 *             `_engineTrusted` (fs-fit.js) only ever moves on the SECOND miss, so a switch that
 *             flips wrongly — an engine still anchoring correctly loses the theme's trust in it two
 *             ticks later — is invisible to anything that never performs a second one (task
 *             missrule). Both the reader's position after every refill and the trust flag itself
 *             are read; the flag going false while the reader never moved is its own finding,
 *             separate from the reader actually moving. It measures on the SAME section SWAP just
 *             measured — `window.__fsRepeatSection`, not a second search — because a second search
 *             run after SWAP's own two refills can land on a worse candidate than the one SWAP
 *             already proved reaches the scroller (274/274 cells measured nothing before this was
 *             fixed; SWAP's own coverage in the same run is the comparison).
 *
 * The growth in `held`/`swapped`/`quiet` is inserted rather than waited for: a real tick depends on
 * what the router's radios are doing, and a gate that only fails when a station happens to join is
 * not a gate. `tick` is the one case that measures a real one anyway, for the fault only a real tick
 * can show.

 *   processes    one table, a direct child of `#view`. The climb out of it used to land on the host
