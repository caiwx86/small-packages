/* The navigation gate: a page opened by a click must be the same page a full load gives.
 *
 * The theme replaces LuCI's full-page navigation with a client router (docs/spa-router.md), and that
 * is one long list of things a fresh document does for free: an empty uci cache, an empty poll
 * queue, no stray intervals, no leftover notifications, a re-stamped body[data-page], a view
 * constructed rather than a cached singleton reused. Every one of those has been wrong at least
 * once.
 *
 * So this gate does not check the router's mechanics: it opens every page BOTH ways and compares
 * what the user ends up with — how much the view painted, which config packages are in uci's cache
 * (the axis that catches a state bug with no visible symptom: a page can render the same characters
 * either way while `uci.state.values` is `{}` after a click), how many wifi devices network.js
 * answers with, and whether the click path threw where a full load did not.
 *
 * There is no baseline: a difference between the two ways of opening the same page is always a bug,
 * and if a page is legitimately different it does not belong in the menu.
