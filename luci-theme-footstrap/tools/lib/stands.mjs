 * shredded to one character per line (#11), a submenu title clipped (#22), a doubled scrollbar in
 * Firefox (#12), a third-party app's tabs laid out wrong (#36, #33, #8), a client navigation that
 * painted less than a full load (upstream review). None can be seen in a stylesheet; all are one
 * query away on a live page.
 *
 * The routers are owlab's — `owlab status -json` names each one and the port it answers on, so
 * nothing here hard-codes a port or a container name. Nothing here boots anything either: a gate
 * that starts and stops containers by itself is a gate nobody runs locally. */

 * fails here before it reaches a user. `--all` widens to every running OpenWrt router (the -b/-c/-d
 * twins); a gate that takes `--only` must honour `--all` too.
 *
 * ImmortalWrt is not a gate target at all, since 0.14.13: same luci-base, different brand and app

 * the stands: the app stays (its lazily-inserted Ace stylesheets are the one adversary that can
 * invert the cascade layer order — owlab.yaml), the request simply never leaves. The gates stop
 * depending on the network, on a rate limit, and on how fast github.com answers today.
