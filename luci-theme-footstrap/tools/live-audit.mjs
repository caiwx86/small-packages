/* The page gate: every page the router's menu offers, at every width that matters, measured for the
 * faults that have actually reached users.
 *
 * The static gates read the stylesheet; every field report so far was about a PAGE — a column
 * shredded to one character per line (#11), a submenu title clipped (#22), an indicator that did
 * not fit the sidebar (#14), a hidden tab pane leaving phantom scroll (#10), a doubled scrollbar
 * in Firefox (#12), a widget or a whole app laid out wrong (#5, #15, #32, #33, #36). Not one is
 * visible in a file, and every one is one DOM query away on a live page.
 *
 * WHAT IT LOOKS FOR: `doc-scroll` (the document scrolls sideways — the symptom users report as
 * "вёрстка плывёт", #1), `overflow` (past the content column with nothing to scroll it back),
 * `clipped` (a non-scroller whose content is wider than itself), `target` (a hit target under
 * 24x24 CSS px with a neighbour inside 24px of its centre — WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 with its spacing
 * exception), `noname` (an operable element with no accessible name — SC 4.1.2, the one a11y
 * failure a stylesheet CAN cause), `ungated-table`/`unanswered-table` (see below),
 * `nested-scroll` (two scrollports stacked on the shell), `dead-floor` (see below), `geometry` (the chrome's model against
 * the real box) and `console` (a view that threw while rendering). The width sweep starts at 320,
 * which is the narrowest reflow WCAG 1.4.10 requires.
 *
 * A BASELINE, NOT A CLEAN SHEET. Some findings belong to the app, not the theme, and a gate that
 * fails on them is a gate that gets disabled. So every finding is signed `path|width|kind|element`
 * and the known set lives in tools/baselines/live-audit.json: a NEW signature fails the run, a
 * signature that stopped appearing is printed so the baseline can shrink. A ratchet, exactly like
 * css-metrics.mjs. The file is a UNION ACROSS PLATFORMS, not a photograph of one machine — text
 * metrics differ between a maintainer's containers and CI's runner, and a few findings sit within
 * a pixel of their threshold.
 *
 *   node tools/live-audit.mjs [--only owrt2512,owrt2410] [--widths 320,390,768,1440]
 *                             [--pages /admin/status] [--pages-all] [--all] [--arrive 768]
 *                             [--update] [--prune] [--engine chromium|firefox|webkit] [--lang ru]
 *                             [--settle 460]
 *
 * Needs a running owlab router (docs/development.md). `--update` rewrites the baseline: read the
 * diff before you do that — it is the whole value of the file.
 *
 * `--settle` (task livegate): the resize loop below used to sample EVERYTHING 220ms after each
 * `setViewportSize`, which is 180ms INSIDE `fs-fit.js`'s own `SCROLL_IDLE` (400ms) — the window the
 * theme deliberately defers every layout-reading pass behind while it judges the page to still be
 * moving, and which a fast back-to-back sweep across WIDTHS keeps re-arming on every step. Sampling
 * `doc-scroll`/`overflow`/`clipped`/`target`/the table and floor checks there reads the state the
 * theme is holding off on and reports it as a layout break — measured directly as CI's
 * `geometry|fs-content` finding on `/admin/status/vnstat2/config`, whose offset was always exactly
 * the gap between two adjacent WIDTHS entries, never a real number.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT FIXES FOR TWO DIFFERENT PROMISES, not one. `1cd2af1` fixed `fs-chrome.js`'s
 * `contentWidth()` so it re-reads the window's width on every call regardless of the defer window —
 * GEOMETRY's own promise is "the model matches reality NO MATTER WHEN you ask" (fs-select reads it
 * mid-scroll too), so GEOMETRY stays sampled IMMEDIATELY, before `SETTLE_MS`, same as before —
 * `docs/development.md` says outright not to "fix" a recurrence of this shape by sampling later
 * instead, and reproduced directly (task livegate, `1cd2af1` reverted in a scratch copy): sampled at
 * 220ms it reads the stale model (`off=-70` at 320->390 through `off=-936` at 1440, matching the
 * vnstat2 shape exactly), sampled ONLY past `SCROLL_IDLE` it reads clean — the SAME bug, hidden,
 * because by then the deferred pass has simply had time to run and paper over a model that is still
 * broken. So GEOMETRY is sampled BOTH ways (see below) and stays exactly as exposed to this class of
 * regression as it always was. Every OTHER check's promise is "the page IS laid out correctly", which
 * needs the deferred pass to have actually RUN — those depend on `SETTLE_MS`, past `SCROLL_IDLE`, not
 * on a self-correcting read, and moving only them fixes the 220ms false report without reintroducing
 * the one `1cd2af1` closed. 460ms clears the 400ms floor with the same margin `SCROLL_IDLE`'s own
 * comment gives it.
 *
 * `--lang` (task 0162): the checks that read TEXT LENGTH — `overflow`, `clipped`, `doc-scroll` — are
 * pinned to whatever language the router happens to answer in, and the default is English (Playwright's
 * browser locale is en-US, and `luci.main.lang=auto` resolves against it). Switching a router to
 * Russian by hand and running the unmodified gate produced 77 findings on one stand and 70 on the
 * other — not regressions, RU text is measurably longer (docs/gallery.html's pseudo-loc gate uses
 * 1.3-1.6x for the same reason) — and every one would have failed the run, because the baseline held
 * only what English measured. `--lang` sets `luci.main.lang` on each router before the sweep (`en`
 * maps to `auto`, same convention as `.claude/tooling/lang.mjs`) and restores `auto` after, and the
 * baseline key gets the language appended exactly like `--engine` already appends the engine — a
 * Russian-only overflow is a REAL, distinct signature, not the English baseline's problem, so it earns
 * its own entry (`owrt2512@ru`) rather than either failing every English run or being silently
 * swallowed into the language-agnostic checks (`noname`, `target`, `console`, …) which do not need
 * this at all. The alternative — recording only language-independent findings — would have hidden the
 * ssclash label/section bug this task started from, which WAS a length fault. */
