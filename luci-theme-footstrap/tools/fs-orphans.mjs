/* Dead-selector check, scoped to the theme's OWN namespace, and the scoping is the whole point.
 *
 * PurgeCSS and friends are actively dangerous here: content is rendered by third-party luci-app-*
 * JS, so a `.cbi-*` selector with no example on this router is still styled for the package that
 * emits it on someone else's, and anything pruning what it did not SEE rendered un-themes other
 * people's apps (docs/conventions.md). We never ask "was this rule exercised".
 *
 * `.fs-*` is OURS: only this theme's templates and JS can emit one, so inside that namespace, and
 * only there, "nothing we ship emits this class" really does mean dead. Every LuCI/cbi class is
 * ignored on purpose — that is the set the coverage contract protects.
 *
 *   FORWARD  — styled but never emitted: left behind when markup is deleted. Gated.
 *   REVERSE  — emitted but never styled: dead markup, a typo, or something riding on inherited
 *              base styles. Reported only.
