# this the wrapper launders any command past the `ask` fence on the hardware router and on
# publishing. The fence has to live here, where the whole command line is visible.
#
# This is a guardrail against the wrapper laundering a command past a permission rule, not a
# sandbox: it reads the text of the command, so it can be fooled by anything the text itself does
# not reveal (an alias, a script that shells out, a binary named to match nothing here). What it
# does catch is scanned as words, not substrings, so `sshd` or a path ending in `-ssh` does not
# trip it. Backslashes are deleted (not folded to a separator) BEFORE the quoting and shell
# operators are folded to spaces, so `s\sh` collapses to the `ssh` it will actually become when the
# shell reassembles it, rather than scanning as two harmless words.
