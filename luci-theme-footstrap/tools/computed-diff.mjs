/* Prove a CSS change by diffing computed styles, on the gallery instead of a router.
 *
 * The method is docs/css.md's: one DOM, one data set, two stylesheets — load the page, snapshot
 * getComputedStyle over every element, swap the <link>, snapshot again. Any difference was caused
 * by the CSS, because nothing else moved.
 *
 * What is new here is the SURFACE. On a live router the same sheet twice moves 0.5-1.3% of pixels
 * (uptime, DHCP leases, signal) and a real regression weighs 0.19% — the noise buries the signal,
 * which is why screenshots do not work and why a live computed diff still needs a control pass to
 * learn each page's floor. docs/gallery.html has no clock, no poll and no data: `--control` runs the
 * SAME stylesheet on both sides and must report exactly 0 differences. That 0 is the threshold, and
 * it is measured rather than chosen — run `--control` whenever the gallery gains a widget.
 *
 * This does not replace the live run. The gallery has every widget and none of the pages: no menu,
 * no chrome, no third-party sheet. It catches the regression that is IN the stylesheet; owlab
 * catches the one that is in the page.
 *
 * Two viewports run, not one (task 0145): every other gallery gate — this one included, until now —
 * takes Playwright's 1280 default (`a11y`, `export-tier`) or sets it explicitly (line below), so a
 * declared width that only drifts once a flex row is narrower than its own content never shows up.
 * cb1's own bug was exactly that shape: 0 diffs at 1280 with the fix reverted, a `width` diff at 390.
 * A container query answered by 1280 alone was answered by nothing; VIEWPORTS below is the fix.
 *
 *   node tools/computed-diff.mjs                 # worktree vs HEAD, light + dark, both viewports
 *   node tools/computed-diff.mjs --control       # the same sheet twice: the threshold, must be 0
 *   node tools/computed-diff.mjs --against v0.15.0 --full --max 0

 * repo already reaches for on a phone-width claim (owrt2512/390x844 elsewhere in that file). The gap
 * this closes: a caption turns the switch pill into a SECOND, shrinkable flex item only once the row
 * is narrower than the pill + caption's combined natural width, which never happens at 1280 — so a
 * declared `width` sitting at exactly `--sw-w` on both sides of a diff there proves nothing, the flex
 * shrink that broke it never engaged. Measured with the flex-shrink:0 fix reverted in a scratch copy:
