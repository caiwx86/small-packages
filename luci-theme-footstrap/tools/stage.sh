# `owfeed build` packages a DIRECTORY; it does not build one. Everything the OpenWrt SDK used to do
# on the way in — concatenate the stylesheet, mangle the private custom properties, strip the
# comments out of the templates and the shell, stamp the version — has to happen before it. The one
# step it does NOT do is the translation catalogue: owfeed compiles the .po files itself,
# byte-identical to po2lmo, and requiring po2lmo would put a C build of luci-base in front of anyone
# packaging this theme.
#
# The order is the Makefile's, step for step (see Build/Prepare there):
#
#   1. copy       luci.mk's install mapping: htdocs -> /www, ucode -> /usr/share/ucode/luci, root -> /
#   2. build-css  cascade.css is generated from styles/ and is not in the tree
#   3. mangle     the private --fs-* names, reading the reserved set from the SOURCE
#   4. minify     terser over the staged JS
#   5. strip      {# … #} out of the templates, whole-line # out of the shell
#   6. stamp      FS_VERSION, after the minify — minify-js.mjs keeps that declaration verbatim
#                 precisely so this sed still matches
#
# The lifecycle scripts are EXTRACTED from the Makefile rather than kept as files beside it: they
# exist there already, they are what an SDK build installs, and two copies of a postrm that only
# runs on somebody else's router months later is the worst duplication in this repo to let rot. `$$`
# is make's escaping for a literal `$`, so it is undone here.

# ---- one package per language, the way luci.mk emits them ----

# The catalogues used to ship INSIDE the theme: 10,992 B on flash and 4,821 B of the .apk, paid by
# every router including the ones reading English. Split out, a Russian router installs
# luci-i18n-footstrap-ru and nobody else carries it.
#
# owfeed's `i18n.from` compiles every language under one directory into one package, so each
# language gets its own staging directory holding only its own .po — that is all these two loops
# build. The package NAMES are luci.mk's (`luci-i18n-$(LUCI_BASENAME)-<lang>`, and LUCI_BASENAME is
# `footstrap`), and so is the catalogue basename, so an SDK build and this one produce the same
# package for the same router.
#
# The uci-defaults line is luci.mk's too: without it the language never appears in LuCI's own
# language menu, and the catalogue loads only for someone who set the language by hand.
# The label is LuCI's own, copied from luci.mk's LUCI_LANG.<code> table rather than invented: it is
# what the language menu shows, and every luci-i18n-* package on the router writes the same string
# for the same code. A language with no entry here stops the build — registering the bare code would
# put "ru" in a menu that reads "Русский (Russian)" everywhere else.
