# Keeping the reader's place: the log

Every finding behind the mechanisms in [anchoring.md](anchoring.md), one heading per finding: what
was seen, what it turned out to be, the command and the numbers that tell the two apart, and the
attempts that were measured and rejected. `fs-fit.js` cites a heading here instead of carrying the
narrative; [anchoring.md](anchoring.md) is the reference — what each mechanism is and the one number
that justifies it.

Entries are grouped by the mechanism they belong to, not by date. A rejected attempt stays: it is
the cheapest way to keep the next reader from measuring it again.

## Why WebKit looked like it was mis-anchoring

**`overflow-anchor` stopped being able to say "this engine's anchoring can be trusted", the day
WebKit shipped it too — task wkanchor.** All three now answer `true`, and parked mid-page with real
poll ticks landing (`tools/scroll-anchor.mjs`'s `tick` case), the offset still moved on WebKit — no
`scrollTo`, no `scrollTop` setter recorded — 21px on the Overview's default park
(`../tmp/task-overview12/tick-probe.mjs`), 41px at 390 wide in the bar/top layout. Task wkanchor read
that as WebKit's own scroll anchoring getting a real correction wrong and shipped `ENGINE_MISANCHORS`
(`fs-fit.js`, `-webkit-hyphenate-limit-before`) to turn WebKit's anchoring off on the theme's own
scroller wherever it fired, `overflow-anchor: none` under `data-fs-anchor-suppress`
(`theme/20-shell.css`). `lateDrift()` had already been writing the drift back one rAF plus
`SCROLL_IDLE` later — measured 421/421/408ms after the tick — and the new mechanism was meant to make
that correction unnecessary rather than merely late.

**That diagnosis was wrong — task barpin.** Nothing about WebKit's own anchoring was misfiring: the
bar itself was moving. `fitChrome()` (fs-chrome.js) pins the bar's box against SHRINKING while it
measures whether the menu still fits, so the question can be asked with the layout classes off, but
until this task it pinned only that direction — with the classes off, and again as `fs-bar-stack`/
`fs-ind-compact` are added back one at a time, the bar's OWN height was free to answer whatever its
content needed at that instant, up to 107px taller than its settled height, one synchronous pass at a
time. `fitChrome()` runs once per poll-driven mutation, and the Overview's own poll batches
System/Memory/Storage into several separate `MutationObserver` callbacks rather than one — so the
walk landed as a sequence of real, differently-sized boxes with a paint between them, and EVERY
engine followed it, not only WebKit. Chromium and Firefox hid that behind their own scroll anchoring,
each correcting its own move before the next one landed; WebKit has no anchoring of its own to hide
behind, so the walk showed up directly as drift, and `lateDrift()` — built to clean up after an
anchoring engine's own residual — was instead cleaning up after this. `tools/fit-quiet.mjs`, extended
to watch the bar's height in both directions rather than only the dip, measured the walk directly:
230 → 202 → 164 → 144 → 123 → 131 → 123px against a settled 123px, 107px of growth a floor alone
never sees. `fitChrome()` now pins the bar's height BOTH ways for the whole decision and releases the
pin only once the final class set is chosen, right before the height is published — nothing the pass
measures (`stripFitsOneRow()`'s `offsetTop`, `clusterFitsBrandRow()`'s widths) reads the bar's own
height, so the pin changes nothing about which classes get chosen. With that in place, the same
probe that measured 21-41px on WebKit reads 0px at 390/top with the suppression removed entirely, 26s
of real poll ticks (`../tmp/task-toplayout/top-probe.mjs --unsuppress`) — `ENGINE_MISANCHORS` and
`data-fs-anchor-suppress` are gone from the tree (`fs-fit.js`, `theme/20-shell.css`): there was never
a WebKit-specific fault for them to hold.

`ENGINE_MISANCHORS`/`data-fs-anchor-suppress` is not in the table above — task barpin removed it
from the tree entirely rather than leaving a row that says "not needed". The 21-41px it was built to
answer was real (below), but the cause was `fitChrome()`'s own bar changing height inside its
measurement pass, not WebKit's anchoring; once that pin covers both directions the drift is 0px on
WebKit with no suppression at all, so there was nothing left for the attribute to gate.

**A correction that is merely LATE reads as "the reader stayed put" to every case that closes before
it lands — task wkanchor.** `held`/`swapped` insert their own growth and close within 800ms of it;
`quiet` discards any step where the offset held still for 400ms, since its own subject is a reader
in motion. The fault `tick` was built for is neither: nothing is inserted, the reader is parked, and
`lateDrift()`'s correction lands 421ms after the tick — past `quiet`'s 400ms-still discard and well
inside `held`/`swapped`'s 800ms window, but neither of those two ever watches a PARKED reader across
a REAL tick, only a synthetic one it grew itself. `tick` is the fourth case this shape needed: it
parks the reader, leaves the poll running rather than stopping it (the one thing `held`/`swapped` do
that this case cannot), and watches the offset across ticks timed off the page's own
`L.env.pollinterval` — a fixed multiple of `pollinterval` was tried first and rejected, since one
real tick on the Overview batches System/Memory/Storage into several separate `MutationObserver`
callbacks and a count-based stop read all of them as separate ticks, closing the case after about
two seconds of page time and reporting 0px on the exact cell a time-based window (and
`tick-probe.mjs`) reported 21px on. Also layout-dependent in a way the other three cases are not:
0px at `390 side` (the sidebar collapsed to a bar under `data-narrow`) against 41px at `390 top` (the
bar layout proper) — same page, same tick, same engine, `data-layout` still carrying a difference
under the collapse that `held`/`swapped`/`quiet` never needed to know about, since which element
scrolls is the same either way. `390 top` joins the default (non-`--full`) axis for every case as a
result, not only `tick`'s own — a regression here would otherwise only be caught on a push or a tag.


## When the platform check was not enough: how the fork was measured


`ENGINE_ANCHORS` answers once, at load, whether the property EXISTS — it cannot see an engine that
has it but declines to use it on a given refill, which CI showed does happen: two passes where a
real engine anchored the platform check trusted but left the correction to `lateDrift()`, the
theme's cleanup path for an anchoring engine's own residual (`lateDrift()`, above). That path is
built to be a safety net, not the primary corrector, and it answers slowly on purpose: it waits a
frame, then reads the offset again after `SCROLL_IDLE` (400ms) to make sure the reader has not
started scrolling in between. Task latenet's four-way SWAP ablation put a number on what that costs
when the net is actually the one doing the work: `overflow-anchor: none` alone (engine off, theme
still on the `ENGINE_ANCHORS` path) — `lateDrift()` carries the correction at 419-420ms. Both halves
suppressed together (`fsEngineAnchor=off` plus the CSS rule, the shape accc451 shipped) —
`applyAnchor()` carries it at 7ms on chromium/firefox, 32-36ms on webkit. Neither number changed for
the base case (untouched): the engine corrects itself, 0ms, 3/3 reps on every engine.

So the fork in the mutation observer (`observeContent()`) no longer trusts `ENGINE_ANCHORS` for the
whole session once the evidence says otherwise. `lateDrift()` already computes the residual after
every refill the theme did not correct itself; each one it actually has to write back increments
`_lateMisses`, and once that count reaches `LATE_MISS_LIMIT` (2 — one residual is headroom for a
single one-off, since a page that corrects at all some of the time is not the same fault as one that
never does; a second is the count, not a guess), `_engineTrusted` goes false and every later refill
on that page takes the `anchorFor()` → `scheduleAnchor()` path instead — the one `applyAnchor()`
measures at 7-36ms rather than `lateDrift()`'s 419-420ms. (Task late419 has since taken that second
number to 8-61ms for a page that was already still when the refill landed; what still separates the
two paths is that this one waits out a reader who IS moving.) The comment at the increment site claims
only what is measured: "this engine did not keep the reference across a container refill, N times on
this page" — never a browser name, because the count is what is asked, not the identity. Chromium and
Firefox measure 0 residuals on the pages this sweep covers, so `_lateMisses` never advances for them
and the switch cannot trip.

**What the gate had to learn to see this at all.** `tools/scroll-anchor.mjs`'s `SWAP` case used to
read the mark once, at a single fixed delay (800ms), which cannot tell "never corrected" from
"corrected after the delay had already been long enough to hide it" — the CI failure that opened
task latenet was exactly that: a `--settle` read at 300ms reported the full drift, the same cell at
500ms reported 0px, and neither number said whether the correction was fast, late, or absent.
`swap()` now samples the mark every frame for `SWAP_WINDOW` (900ms — comfortably past the measured
419-420ms, with margin for a loaded runner) and records `correctedAt`, the first frame the drift
falls back under `TOLERANCE`. A drift still outside tolerance at the end of the window is reported as
"never came back"; one that corrected but past `LATE_MS` — 200ms, picked because it sits roughly
midway between the two measured clusters (7-36ms fast path, 419-420ms slow path) with well over
150ms of headroom either side, so ordinary CI jitter cannot cross it — is reported as "corrected
late", a finding in its own right even though the reader ends up in the right place: 420ms of visible
drift is what a maintainer reading a bug report calls a jump, not a pass. Chromium and Firefox stay
under 36ms on every cell this sweep reaches, so the threshold does not trip for them either.

**Coverage `SWAP` does not have, and does not claim.** The full CI sweep (`--full`) measures 91 of
171 cells; 80 are skipped because nothing above the reader on that page/width/layout/density
combination is big enough to collapse (`nothing above the reader big enough to collapse`, the same
skip the `.fs-ovl` grid case uses). Widening what `SWAP` can measure — a smaller minimum collapse
size, or picking a body nearer the fold instead of the tallest one entirely above it — is a change to
what the case tests, not a flag on top of it, and is out of scope here.


## How long to wait: the fork that closed the 419 ms road

`lateDrift()` waited `SCROLL_IDLE` (400ms) after its own first frame before it would write, whatever
the page had been doing, so a refill the engine declined to anchor was corrected 419ms after it
happened. The reader ends up in the right place; they see a jump getting there, which is what the
sweep's `LATE_MS` threshold (200ms) exists to call out.

**It survived three CI runs of one commit — green, red, red, the same cell each time.** `webkit
owrtsnap @1440 side compact, engine-anchoring on, overview`: `the correction landed 419ms after the
refill … writes: [{"t":29054,"how":"scrollTop=maincontent","val":1014}]`. One write, at the offset
the reader needed, 419ms late. A full local sweep — 552 runs, three engines, three twins — found it
zero times, because on an unloaded machine WebKit anchors that refill every time and `lateDrift()`
is never the corrector. The green run was the engine working, not the theme.

**The gate could only see it by accident, so it was given a way to see it on purpose.** The
`noEngineAnchor` axis had two states and neither can reach the one that failed: with the engine on
the engine does the work, and with `fsEngineAnchor=off` the theme KNOWS it is alone and takes
`applyAnchor()` (7-36ms) instead. The state CI caught is the third — the engine declining while the
theme still trusts it — and it is one `addInitScript` away: the same `overflow-anchor: none`
stylesheet without the `localStorage` half. `tools/scroll-anchor.mjs` now runs that as a third cell
per group, printed `engine DECLINES`, skipping TICK and REPEAT exactly as the `OFF` cell does (REPEAT
for the opposite reason: there `_engineTrusted` going false is the switch working, so its "the flag
tripped while the reader never moved" finding would fire on correct behaviour). **Red on HEAD,
deterministically: 9 cells of 9 — chromium 409/419/420ms, firefox 404/415/417ms, webkit
421/421/422ms**, three engines against `owrt2512b`/`owrt2410b`/`owrtsnapb`, on a machine under no load
at all.

**The cause, once it was reproducible on demand.** 419-421ms is the timer itself: one rAF plus
`SCROLL_IDLE`. That wait is there because a frame cannot tell a flick from a still page by the offset
alone — a flick moves it in steps of tens of milliseconds, two rAFs fall inside one step, and 120ms
was measured letting a 160px correction through on a loaded runner. But the page in this cell was
provably still before the refill and nothing but the refill happened during it, and this file already
knows that: `scrolling()` is its own answer to "has anything moved the offset in the last
`SCROLL_IDLE`", sampled from the POSITION every frame, and `_userUntil` is the reader's hand on the
page — `touchstart`, `wheel`, `mousedown` and `keydown` all arrive BEFORE the offset they are about
to move. Where both say nobody is driving and nothing has moved, the only thing that can have touched
the offset since the reference was taken is the engine, and the engine's own correction window is
7-36ms, not 400. So the wait forks: the next frame where the page was already still, the full
`SCROLL_IDLE` where it was not. The `scrollTop() !== seen` check that decides whether to write is
unchanged and runs on both paths — the fork decides HOW LONG to wait, never WHETHER to write.

**Measured: 404-422ms → 8-61ms**, the same nine cells and the same command. The other two states of
the axis do not move, which is the point — `engine-anchoring on` corrects at 4-19ms (the engine's own
work, which never reaches this path) and `engine-anchoring OFF` at 6-44ms (`applyAnchor()`, a
different function) — and `mid-flick surprises` reads 0 on all 27.

**Two negative results worth keeping.**

*Neither guard would do alone, and the direction this task started from was the intent check on its
own.* `_userUntil` is a 400ms timer off the last EVENT, and iOS momentum carries the page long after
the finger has gone — the fault `scrolling()` was built for in the first place. It is also not
hypothetical in the gate: `QUIET` drives its 24 flick steps by assigning `scrollTop`, so it carries
no intent event at all, and an intent-only fork would take the short path straight through the middle
of the one case whose subject is a correction landing inside a scroll. The other direction is
narrower but real: `scrolling()` alone would write in the moment a finger is down on a page that has
not moved yet.

*A third frame buys nothing and costs headroom.* `settleDeferredFloor()`'s shape is two rAFs, one
apart — the offset read twice a frame apart IS the check, and the wait only spaces the two reads.
Written with an extra frame first, webkit read 67/71/72ms against 51/54/61ms with two, everything
else identical; the extra frame is 11-16ms of the margin under `LATE_MS` for no change in any
reading.


## A witness at the fold can be blind


`lateDrift()`'s drift is `el.getBoundingClientRect().top - was`, and `el` is whatever `anchorRef()`
hit-tested at the fold the last time the page was still — not guaranteed to sit below the container
THIS tick refilled, and an element's own top does not move when growth happens somewhere it is not
connected to. Reproduced on CI, the same finding across three SHAs (1e88310, 7ff9e56, 76b3c7a):
`webkit owrtsnap @1440 side compact, engine-anchoring on, overview` — a section refilled the way a
poll refills one and the page never came back, still 120px off after the 900ms `SWAP_WINDOW`. Of
`lateDrift()`'s five refusals, `drift < 1px` fired 13 of 13 refills — `anchorRef()`'s hit test lands
on a different element per density (a plain `DIV` at top -362 in compact, `DIV.network-status-table`
at top -33 in normal), and the compact one sits where the growth never reaches it: a reference there
reads 0px whether the engine corrected or not, and the code reads that zero as "the engine put it
back." `_lateMisses` never advanced (identical numbers on 7ff9e56, before the counter existed)
because incrementing needs a WRITE and `lateDrift()` never wrote one — the raw scroll offset stayed
at `+0` for the whole window, `SWAP`'s own diagnostic metric confirming the theme's net never
engaged at all.

`lateDrift()` now takes a second witness that cannot make that mistake: `grow`, the height the
mutation's own target actually gained. `observeContent()`'s `MutationObserver` callback receives
`records` (previously discarded) and finds the first `childList` record whose target already wears
`data-fs-floor` — the mark `holdFloor()` writes at "the height it had at the last settled moment,
written BEFORE the tick" (anchoring.md) — and reads its `offsetHeight` against that pin right in the
callback: the mutation has already happened, so this IS the container's final height, and nothing
here waits on the engine, which only ever moves the SCROLL POSITION, never an element's own size. A
carried-forward number cannot misread the way a live reference can if the container is later gone.
Where `el`'s own drift already reads under 1px AND `grow` is over 1px, the residual is `grow` minus
however much the offset already moved since the reference was taken (`seen - ref.at` — `seen`, not a
fresh read, since the guard above it already proved the offset has not changed since): an engine
that anchored moves the offset by (about) the growth, one that declined leaves it where it was. The
other four refusals (`_lateFrame` already pending, the page navigated away, the reader is moving,
over a viewport) are untouched — the fault was never the tolerance, only that the question was asked
of an element that need not have moved.

**The gate had to learn to say which refusal fired, too.** `SWAP`'s "never came back" finding string
omitted `swap.writes` — the scroll-write log — though the "corrected late" finding beside it already
carried it, which is exactly why three CI runs of the same finding could not say whether the theme
wrote nothing at all or wrote somewhere the mark did not see. Both branches now print it: an empty
array means `lateDrift()` never wrote, matching `_lateMisses` staying at 0.

**Proof.** Rebuilt `owrtsnap`, webkit, `@1440 side compact`: `swap moved 0px [offset +120] corrected
16ms` — where CI read `still 120px off … [writes: []]` before the fix (the fault itself did not
reproduce locally even before the fix, on the rebuilt image — CI's three SHAs are the reproduction).
`normal` and `large` stay green on the same cell. Chromium and Firefox stay at 0px on every
default-axis cell of `overview` this sweep reaches. `fit-quiet` (0px peak-to-peak, 3 widths) and
`SWAP`'s own `TICK` case (0px, 20 mutations observed) are unmoved — the hot path this task touches
runs on every anchoring pass, not only the one CI caught.


## The witness is not safe to write on its own

**The witness is not safe to write on its own — task detector.** This page used to say a false
witness here "only ever refuses, never writes"; that was reasoned, not measured, and the very next
CI run measured it false: 21 findings, both webkit and firefox, all on `/admin/network/dhcp @390`,
every density, both layouts, both stands, every one printing `writes:
[{"how":"window.scrollTo",…}]` beside a `swap.clamped` the gate itself already reported — and the
overshoot equalled that clamp in every single one. Instrumented directly against the failing shape
(route interception on `fs-fit.js`, the SWAP case lifted from the gate itself): the 32-36-row leases
table `SWAP` empties and refills grows its floor box by 128-132px against a 120px pad — table-row
rounding at 390 wide, not the pad — while `compensated` (`seen - ref.at`, how much the OFFSET already
moved since the reference) reads exactly 120px, matching the pad: the engine had already carried out
the whole correction, and `grow`'s own rounding (8-12.25px, the exact overshoot of every finding) was
the only thing the old formula still read as outstanding. Writing that gap back is a second
correction on top of one the engine already made — not a case `grow` failing to see growth (it saw
the growth correctly), but the formula treating "the engine responded, imprecisely" the same as "the
engine never responded at all". The cluster, spelled out: **8px (compact), 12px (normal/large,
webkit), 12.25px (large, firefox)** — three points tight against a 120px pad, none of them a
residual.

The two are now told apart by what the OFFSET did, not only by what the CONTAINER did.
`compensated` exactly zero is the blind case above, unchanged: the engine never touched the offset,
`grow` is the only witness that saw it, and the whole growth is still the correction. `compensated`
anything else means the engine already moved the offset roughly by its own anchoring, and the
residual is this witness's own rounding, not a number to write — it counts as a miss instead (the
same `_lateMisses` bookkeeping `_engineTrusted` above already keeps) and `lateDrift()` returns
without writing, leaving the correction to `anchorFor()`/`scheduleAnchor()` once `LATE_MISS_LIMIT`
trips — a path that reads the offset back rather than a container's raw height and does not share
this failure.

**Proof.** All 21 CI-failing cells, re-measured through the real gate against the fix
(`tools/scroll-anchor.mjs`, `owrt2512` and `owrtsnap`, webkit and firefox, `@390` `side` and `top`,
`normal`/`compact`/`large`, `/admin/network/dhcp`): `swap moved 0px`, engine alone, no write logged —
zero findings, 24 runs on webkit and 24 on firefox. The overview cell above is unaffected:
`compensated` reads 120px there, matching `grow` to within rounding, so neither branch's write fires
and the cell already passes on its own — the same 0px this page's earlier "Proof" already recorded.


## A miss must mean the engine declined, not that the witness rounded

**A miss must mean the engine did not do the job, not that this witness rounded — task missrule.**
Task detector's own fix counted EVERY non-zero gap between `compensated` and `grow` as a miss,
`>= 1`, no matter how small. On `/admin/network/dhcp @390` that gap is 8-12.25px of table-row
rounding, not a residual — so two ticks (10s, `LATE_MISS_LIMIT` is 2) after the fix landed,
`_engineTrusted` went false on an engine that was anchoring that page correctly the whole time. From
the third tick on, EVERY refill took `anchorFor()`/`scheduleAnchor()` **while the engine's own
anchoring was still fully on** — precisely the configuration `ENGINE_ANCHORS`'s own comment warns
against: "running both is not a safety net: two corrections throw the page the other way." §1.17 and
§2.2 of `../tmp/task-anchor-audit/inventory.md` found this the same day the fix above shipped —
"the most important unmeasured consequence in the tree" — because SWAP performs ONE refill and
closes, and `_engineTrusted` only ever moves on the SECOND miss: every one of the 48 green sub-runs
proving the fix above was a first-miss run, and nothing in the suite ever reached a second.

**The three cases, told apart by measurement, not by reasoning this time.** `compensated` exactly
zero — the engine never touched the offset — is unchanged: write the growth back, and that IS a
miss, the engine did nothing. A gap ABOVE `LATE_ROUND_TOLERANCE` (16px, fs-fit.js) is unchanged too:
a real partial failure, no write, and it counts. What changed is the middle: a gap AT OR BELOW 16px
is no longer counted at all — the engine did the job, `lateDrift()` returns having written nothing,
same as the direct `drift < 1` case beside it. 16 is 3.75px (30%) of headroom over the largest of the
three measured gaps (12.25px, large/firefox) — the same margin-over-the-worst-measured-cluster shape
`LATE_MS` already uses ("When the platform check was not enough") — while staying far under half the 120px pad, so a genuine
partial failure that leaves the reader in the middle of it is never mistaken for rounding. Verified
against the formula directly, the three measured gaps plus a boundary and a control:

| case | grow | compensated | gap | write | miss |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| engine did nothing | 120 | 0 | 120 | yes | yes |
| compact rounding | 120 | 112 | 8 | no | **no** (was: yes) |
| normal/large, webkit | 120 | 108 | 12 | no | **no** (was: yes) |
| large, firefox | 120 | 107.75 | 12.25 | no | **no** (was: yes) |
| tolerance edge | 120 | 104 | 16 | no | **no** |
| just past it | 120 | 103.99 | 16.01 | no | yes |
| genuine partial failure | 120 | 60 | 60 | no | yes |

**The gate could not see the switch trip, so it gained a case that can: `REPEAT`**
(`tools/scroll-anchor.mjs`). SWAP's own shape — one refill, then close — is why 48 green sub-runs
never once crossed `LATE_MISS_LIMIT`. `REPEAT` performs `REPEAT_TIMES` (3) of `dom.content()`'s
empty-then-refill cycle on the SAME section, back to back, reading the reader's position after every
one AND `fs-fit.engineTrusted()` (new export, unmarked like `restAt()` — a browser sweep against the
INSTALLED package needs it kept) at the end, so "the reader never moved" and "the switch stayed
trusting" are two separate, both-required assertions rather than one inferred from the other.

**Proof, live, both required shapes, the REAL gate code against the REAL fix (route-interception on
`fs-fit.js`, the same technique as task detector's own proof above — `../tmp/task-missrule/probe3.mjs`,
never committed; `owlab sync` was not used, so the concurrent 3-engine sweep on the same stands was
never touched):**
- `owrt2410`, chromium, `/admin/status/overview @390 top`, a correctly-anchoring cell (`compensated`
  matches `grow` exactly, 0px gap): three consecutive refills, `moved: 0, 0, 0`,
  `trustedBefore: true`, `trustedAfter: true`. The engine did the job every time and the switch never
  moved — the fault this whole task is about, gone.
- `owrt2410`, chromium, `/admin/network/dhcp` (Static Leases tab, a plain `cbi-section-table` the
  probe's own park could get entirely above the fold — the `fs-dt` Active Leases table on THIS
  stand's fixture could not, a container shape difference from whatever CI's routers carried when
  task detector measured 32-36 rows there; noted, not chased further this round): three refills on
  an engine that never anchors this table at all, `moved: -132, -131, -180`, `correctedAt: null`
  throughout — `_lateMisses` reaches 2 on the second refill and `_engineTrusted` goes
  `true -> false` exactly as built. The switch still trips where the engine genuinely declines.

**That proof was never against the shipped `REPEAT` — this task's own developer round found `REPEAT`
measured nothing, anywhere, once it reached a live sweep.** A full three-engine run over
`owrt2512`/`owrt2410`/`owrtsnap` reported 274 of 274 cells `nothing above the reader big enough to
collapse`. Two independent defects, both now fixed:

1. `REPEAT` ran its own body/mark search — the identical selector, the identical park `SWAP` uses —
   but a SECOND time, after `SWAP`'s own two `swap()` passes had already woken `holdFloor()` in
   between. A fresh search there can land on a smaller or grid-absorbed candidate than the one
   `SWAP` just proved reaches the scroller: measured live, an independent search picked
   `table.table.cbi-section-table` (1145px) where `SWAP`'s own search had found a sibling that DID
   reach it. `REPEAT` now reuses `window.__fsRepeatSection` — stashed by `SWAP` the moment it settles
   on a candidate — instead of searching again.
2. `grewDoc` was read AFTER all three of `REPEAT`'s own pads had already been removed — net zero on
   purpose, so even a correctly-picked candidate always reported "the growth never reached the
   scroller." It is now read on the first refill while that pad is still standing, matching `SWAP`'s
   own timing.

Re-run on the same three routers, all three engines, default axes: `REPEAT` measures all 39 of the
39 cells `SWAP` itself measured in the same run (100% parity, up from 0), and it immediately found
**31 real findings, unforced**, on chromium, firefox AND webkit alike: the reader holds through the
first refill of `/admin/status/overview` and `/admin/network/dhcp` but drifts 47-60px on the second
or third back-to-back refill of the SAME section, `corrected: never`. This is the exact shape §2.1
below named "the most important unmeasured consequence in the tree" and could only describe, never
catch — `holdFloor()`'s per-tick `min-height` churn compounding across several ticks rather than one.
**Out of this task's scope: `fs-fit.js` is untouched, and this fault ships unfixed.** `SWAP`, `HOLD`,
`QUIET` and `TICK` are unchanged — 0 findings between them, `mid-flick surprises 0` on all 156 runs.

Confirmed as a real signal rather than a fixture quirk, the same forced-flip technique as the proof
above: a cell that reads clean unpatched (`owrt2410`, chromium, `/admin/status/overview @390 side`,
`moved: 0, 0, 0`, trust `true` throughout) reads `trustedAfter: false` with the reader still not
moving once a route-intercepted, never-synced copy of `fs-fit.js` is made to answer `engineTrusted()`
falsely from its second call on — proof that `REPEAT` fails as readily as it passes.


## Trust that comes back


Before this task, `_engineTrusted` only ever moved one way. Once `LATE_MISS_LIMIT` tripped it false,
every later refill on that page paid `applyAnchor()`'s 7-36ms path for the rest of the session, even
where the two misses that tripped it were the engine having a bad ten seconds rather than a standing
fault — and nothing in the file could tell those two apart, because nothing ever looked again.

**What restores it.** `TRUST_RECOVERY_LIMIT` (2, symmetric with `LATE_MISS_LIMIT` for the identical
reason: one clean refill is headroom for a one-off, a second is the count) consecutive refills where
`_rest.el` — the same remembered reference `lateDrift()` trusts on the trusted path — holds its own
position, on a tick that actually grew something (`grew > 1`, the same growth witness task blindref
already reads off the mutation record). Both counters live in `fs-fit.js`, read in the mutation
callback itself rather than in `applyAnchor()` — the next section is why.

**Two shapes were tried here and both were wrong, not merely pricier — kept in the code's own comment
for the reason both are kept here.**

1. *Read `applyAnchor()`'s own drift.* It already computes `ref.el`'s rect against the remembered
   top before deciding whether to write, the identical measurement `lateDrift()` uses to call a
   miss — so a hit was counted whenever that drift read under a pixel. Live against a real,
   correctly-anchoring engine (`../tmp/task-trust/probe.mjs`, chromium/owrt2410, the Overview's own
   poll-refilled section) this branch never ran at all: `anchorFor()`'s own offset read forces the
   layout the engine's scroll-anchoring resolves against, so by the time it asks "did the reader
   move", the engine has already moved the offset to absorb the growth — and `anchorFor()`, built for
   an engine that does none of that, reads any offset change that is not a downward clamp as the
   READER having scrolled, and returns null. `scheduleAnchor()` then never runs, so `applyAnchor()`
   never sees the one tick that would prove the engine right — 0 hits across 5 genuinely successful
   refills, measured directly against a debug build exporting the counters.
2. *Compare the offset to the growth instead* (`compensated = scrollTop() - _restAt` against `grew`,
   the identical comparison `lateDrift()` makes for its own blind-witness case). This one does see
   the engine work — but it is not strict enough: measured against a genuinely PARTIAL correction (an
   offset that moved by roughly the growth pad's own size), `compensated` matched `grew` within
   `LATE_ROUND_TOLERANCE` while the gate's own independent mark still sat 48px off, uncorrected. A
   container growing by about the right amount, or an offset moving by about the right amount, is not
   the same fact as THIS specific reference holding — task blindref's own finding (a container-shaped
   witness can agree with a bad tick) applies here just as it did to the miss side.

**What holds.** `_rest.el.getBoundingClientRect().top` against `_rest.top`, read directly in the
mutation callback, before `run()` can overwrite `_rest` — the SAME reference and the SAME comparison
`lateDrift()` already trusts on the trusted path, just made here instead of a rAF plus `SCROLL_IDLE`
later, since the engine's own compensation is already visible by the time anything in this callback
reads geometry (the same fact shape 1 above discovered the hard way). The same guards `lateDrift()`
carries against misreading a reader's own scroll as the engine's — `_userUntil`, `scrolling()`,
`_restPage` — apply here too, plus `_rest.el.isConnected` (the reference may not have survived the
tick at all). None of the three shapes measured a version where dropping one of these was safe; the
asymmetry the design leans on throughout is that **a false negative here only delays recovery, while
a false positive un-distrusts an engine that is still getting it wrong** — so where a cheaper shape
could not be told apart from a wrong one, the stricter shape is what shipped.

**Proof.** `../tmp/task-trust/probe.mjs`, real Playwright against the real, route-intercepted
`fs-fit.js` (never synced to a shared router), `owrt2410`/chromium: forced two genuine misses on
`/admin/network/dhcp`'s Static Leases table (a plain `cbi-section-table` this engine never anchors at
all on this fixture) — `trustedBefore: false`, and the reader's own probe mark stayed within a pixel
through all three refills of that phase, `_engineTrusted` correctly still false. An SPA navigation
(a real click through `fs-router`, not a reload — `_engineTrusted`/`_lateHits` are module state and
have to survive it) then moved the SAME page to the Overview, where the SAME engine keeps the
reference on its own poll-refilled section: trust stayed false through 3000ms of real, unscripted
polling (no organic recovery from ambient noise — nothing accidentally counts), then two explicit
refills recovered it (`trustedBefore: true` once the recovery had happened, `moved: 0, 0, 0` for the
three that followed) — the reader's own position never moved in either phase, matching the rule this
whole file exists to hold. Re-checked on firefox and webkit on the same stand: neither ever recovers
falsely — a real, pre-existing drift on this router's webkit build and session churn on firefox both
left `_rest.el` unable to prove a clean hold, the safe side of the asymmetry above rather than the
dangerous one. `tools/fit-quiet.mjs` (0px peak-to-peak on all three widths) and `tools/scroll-anchor
.mjs`'s `tick`/`3x repeat` cases (`trusted true->true`, 0px throughout on the default axis) are
unmoved: this touches only the already-distrusted branch, which the default, correctly-anchoring axis
of either gate cannot reach at all.

**What this does not claim.** `REPEAT`'s own 31 unforced findings (previous section) are a SEPARATE,
open fault — `holdFloor()`'s per-tick churn compounding across several real ticks on the SAME
section — and recovering trust does not touch it: an engine that keeps drifting on the second or
third back-to-back refill of one section still counts misses the ordinary way, and two of them still
trip distrust exactly as before. Recovery only answers the question this task was scoped to: once
distrusted, does the theme have a way back on genuine evidence, or is the flip permanent regardless of
what the engine does afterward.


## A floor that shrinks with nobody watching


`holdFloor()` refuses outright while `scrolling()` reads true (the next section explains why: a
clear-and-remeasure pass is a forced layout, and running one mid-flick is the shaking this whole
file exists to stop). A floored box whose real content shrank while that guard was up does not lose
the shrink — it is simply not cleared THIS tick. The next thing to call `holdFloor()` successfully
was, until this task, `sampleMotion()`'s own termination: `holdFloor(); rememberRest();`, run the
moment the reader is judged still again, wired to neither `lateDrift()` nor `scheduleAnchor()`. The
`min-height` write that call performs is a real scroll-anchor invalidation (`holdFloor()`'s own
citation, css-scroll-anchoring-1 §2.2.2) — the engine reacts to it — and nothing here was reading
whether that reaction was complete.

**Measured** (`../tmp/task-wkrefill/run-probe2.mjs`, webkit/owrt2512b @390 top, normal, the exact
shape `REPEAT` exercises): a growth-then-shrink refill landing entirely inside one motion window —
the pad's own growth starts the sampler, and the probe's own refill cadence does not give it time to
fully settle before the shrink lands — left `_restAt` 59px higher than where it started. `mark`'s
own PAGE position never moved (7441.15625px in every snapshot, before the refill, mid-growth, and
after); its VIEWPORT position read 440 against a `before` of 499, purely because the scroller's
offset itself was left 59px off a page that had not, in fact, changed. The shrink's own `min-height`
write is a scroll-anchor invalidation, so the engine gave back only 61px of the 120px it owed and
the remaining 59px was adopted as truth by the very next `rememberRest()`. `_rest` had already been
re-established on top of that wrong offset — a fresh `anchorRef()` hit test, at whatever the fold
happened to be — so the NEXT refill's own reference (an `H3` this run, a different element from the
`DIV` the reader was originally parked against) showed zero drift for every check after: the
findings this task started from (`webkit owrt2512b/owrt2410b @390 side/top normal overview: refill
2/3 or 3/3 left the reader 58-60px off`) are the visible half of exactly this.

**Three shapes were tried and measured wrong before this one, kept for the reason task trust's own
two are kept above.**

1. *Route the same information through `lateDrift(ref, 0, floorShrink)` from `sampleMotion()`.*
   Collided with the regular mutation's own pending call for the SAME tick: that call's `seen` is
   captured one rAF after the original (refused) mutation, well before `sampleMotion()` ever gets to
   clear the floor, so by the time this second call tried to arm, `_lateFrame` was already occupied
   — and by the time the original call's own 400ms timeout fired, `holdFloor()`'s belated write had
   already moved the offset on its own, read there as `scrollTop() !== seen`, "the reader is still
   moving", and refused too. Two correct guards, aimed at two different questions, defeating each
   other on the one tick both fire for.
2. *Check `_rest.el`'s own drift once the streak of refusals is over,* the same rect comparison
   `lateDrift()` and task trust's own recovery check both already trust. Cannot see this fault BY
   CONSTRUCTION: `_rest` is exactly what gets RE-ESTABLISHED, at whatever the offset happens to be,
   by the very next successful `rememberRest()` — which is a fresh hit test at the CURRENT fold, not
   a check on the OLD one. Once established on an already-59px-wrong offset, the reference it picks
   shows zero drift for ever after, because it was placed AT the wrong position, not moved away from
   the right one. A witness cannot catch a fault in the ground it is itself read off — the third
   instance of the exact class task blindref and task detector already found twice.
3. *Gate the check on `scrolling()`,* the same guard `holdFloor()` itself uses. Refuses on the very
   motion it exists to observe: `holdFloor()`'s belated write is itself what the engine reacts to,
   and that reaction dispatches the `scroll` events which keep re-arming `_movingUntil` — measured,
   `scrolling()` still read true one whole animation frame after the write, on every one of three
   cells, for exactly this reason. `lateDrift()` never makes this mistake; it checks `scrollTop() !==
   seen`, stability between two reads, not "is anything moving at all" — and once this used the same
   check, the guard stopped refusing on its own effect.

**What holds.** `settleDeferredFloor()`, a dedicated frame slot so it cannot collide with either of
`lateDrift()`'s or `scheduleAnchor()`'s, comparing the OFFSET's own response to the shrink directly —
`wanted = offsetBefore - shrink` against the offset two animation frames later, `scrollTop() !==
seen` in between as the stability check — the same `compensated` vs `grow` shape `lateDrift()`'s
blind branch already uses for a GROWTH, made here for a SHRINK `holdFloor()` is about to apply. On a
write, `_rest` is adjusted IN PLACE (`_rest.top -= gap`) rather than re-established through
`rememberRest(true)`: the fourth attempt measured that a forced `rememberRest()` calls `anchorRef()`
regardless of `force`, and `anchorRef()` carries its OWN unconditional `scrolling()` refusal, so a
call landing inside this write's own settling window left `_rest` NULL rather than merely stale — the
very next mutation's `lateDrift()` then had no reference at all and the reader ended up 120px off in
the OTHER direction, worse than doing nothing. `_rest.el` did not move; only the offset it is measured
against did, by exactly `gap`, so its remembered screen position needs adjusting, not re-reading.

**Not counted toward `_lateMisses`** — the same rule `lateDrift()`'s own `floorShrink > 1` skip
already states: this write answers for the theme's own bookkeeping catching up late, not for
anything the engine declined to do on an ordinary tick.

**Proof.** The real gate, not this task's own probe: `node tools/scroll-anchor.mjs --only owrt2512b
--engines webkit --width 390 --layout side|top --page /admin/status/overview` and the same for
`owrt2410b` all read `3x repeat 0px/0px/0px`, `trusted true->true`. A full default-axis webkit sweep
across `owrt2512b`, `owrt2410b` and `owrtsnapb` (overview, dhcp, processes; 390/1440, side/top) found
one residual finding, on `owrt2410b @390 top overview` — `_engineTrusted` still goes false there
(a genuine pair of uncompensated growths on that router's specific webkit build, unrelated to any
floor), but the reader's own position holds at `3x repeat 0px/0px/0px` throughout: a SEPARATE,
pre-existing fault this task did not touch and left for its own investigation — read as the
miss-count's own asymmetry here, which task close later measured and disproved ("The theme's own
floor write is what the engine declines for"). `fit-quiet` (0px peak-to-peak, all widths, all three routers) and `npm run check` are
unaffected: this is additive bookkeeping on a path only a refused `holdFloor()` ever reaches.


## The reference goes stale mid-tick


Task wkrefill's own residual note (previous section) named the shape without chasing it: "the
miss-count's own asymmetry... never cross-checks `compensated` when `drift` reads large rather than
near-zero." This task traced that asymmetry to its source and found it is wider than the miss-count
alone.

**The mechanism.** `lateDrift()`'s baseline (`ref`/`settled`, passed in as `_rest` from BEFORE the
current tick's own `run()`) is only ever refreshed by three things: a WRITE inside `lateDrift()`
itself (forced, `rememberRest(true)`, task refill2's own fix), `scheduleAnchor()`'s forced call on
the untrusted path, and — unforced, unconditional, synchronous — `run()`'s own bare `rememberRest()`
call on EVERY mutation the trusted path does NOT write for. That bare call reads `anchorRef()`'s
geometry in the SAME microtask as the mutation, before the engine has had a rendering step to react
— a mid-transition snapshot, not the settled one `lateDrift()` itself takes 420ms later. Where the
engine settles in one step this is invisible; where it settles gradually (measured live on webkit —
`scrollTop()` still moving 400-900ms after a mutation, task nine's own instrumented
`rememberRest()`) it is not, and the mid-transition value becomes the baseline the NEXT mutation's
own drift is measured against, indistinguishable from a real residual. Confirmed at four call sites:
`run()`'s own line (the main path), `_moFlag`'s and `_moTabs`'s bare `run()` calls (a poll's own
request-in-flight class and a `depends()` re-evaluation can each land inside the same tick as a
growth), and `sampleMotion()`'s deferred-batch `run()`.

**Reproduced directly** (`../tmp/task-nine/probe-overview.mjs`, never synced to a shared stand,
instrumented copy only): three back-to-back growth/shrink cycles on `/admin/status/overview`,
webkit/owrt2410. `_rest.at` drifted 60-120px from the offset the reference was actually taken at,
purely from the ordinary sequence of bare `rememberRest()` calls chasing a still-settling offset —
`_engineTrusted` tripped false on a section the reader never saw move (the mirror of task missrule's
own fault: there, the theme's OWN rounding was counted as an engine failure; here, the theme's own
STALE BASELINE is).

**Two fixes measured, one shipped, one reverted — read before trying either again.**

1. *Refresh `_rest` in `lateDrift()`'s own no-write exits too* (the blind-branch miss, and the plain
   `drift < 1` return), mirroring task refill2's existing write-path fix, gated on `grow > 1 ||
   floorShrink > 1` so an uneventful tick pays nothing extra. Low-risk, principled, and measured to
   change NOTHING on its own (`--only owrt2512,owrt2410,owrtsnap`, all three engines: still 8-10
   findings, same shapes) — because the very next mutation's own bare `run()` call overwrites
   whatever this just fixed before it is ever read. **Shipped** (it does not regress anything and the
   write-path already uses the identical pattern), but it is not the fix on its own.
2. *Defer `run()`'s own bare call the same way `_anchorPending` already defers it for the untrusted
   path* — skip the unforced `rememberRest()` on a trusted tick that has a reference to hand
   `lateDrift()`, at all four call sites above, so lateDrift()'s own settle-verified capture is the
   ONLY thing that ever touches `_rest` on a tick it is watching. This DID close the specific traced
   case (`_rest.at` stayed accurate for all three refills in the isolated probe). It also introduced a
   NEW failure at full-sweep scale that was not visible in the isolated probe: `webkit/owrt2410 @390
   top overview` reported `refill 1/3 left the reader 120px off (corrected 22ms)` — the engine
   corrected briefly, then something moved the page the FULL, uncompensated growth away from it,
   worse than the fault being fixed. Likely cause, not yet confirmed: deferring `run()`'s bare call
   removes a "self-healing" property it incidentally had — even an imperfect mid-transition snapshot
   gets overwritten on the NEXT tick, so a reference that went stale for a reason OTHER than this
   mechanism (this session's own probe runs `REPEAT` after `SWAP`, whose own "floor alone" ablation
   phase runs with the correction path different from the rest of the sweep) no longer self-corrects
   and persists into `REPEAT`'s own park. **Reverted** — the sweep as a whole went from 9-10 findings
   to 9, but with a new, unproven-safe shape among them, which is not the trade this task's acceptance
   asked for.

**What is not yet tried.** Narrowing the defer to `_lateFrame`'s own pending window rather than
"trusted + has a reference" unconditionally — measured NOT to help the specific M1→M2 case this task
traced (`_lateFrame` clears at the top of its own `setTimeout`, ~420ms after the mutation that armed
it, and the interfering mutation in the traced case arrives ~900ms later, well outside that window)
without ALSO moving the `_lateFrame = 0` reset to the end of the callback — untried, because it
changes refusal 1's own timing contract (`lateDrift()`'s doc comment: "one per tick, whichever batch
armed it first") in a way this task did not have the budget to re-measure against `SWAP`/`TICK`/
`QUIET` as well as `REPEAT`. The isolated-probe proof above (`../tmp/task-nine/probe-overview.mjs`)
is scratch, not committed, and the exact shape of the full-sweep regression above was not chased past
naming it — the next session should reproduce it on its own before trying fix 2 again.


## The sweep's own clamp


`REPEAT`'s 47-64px residual (two sections up, left open by task nine) is not a reference going stale
on its own. It starts one pixel at a time, inside `holdFloor()`, and the pixel is the theme's.

**Measured, not reasoned.** An instrumented copy of `fs-fit.js` served by route interception over the
real gate (`../tmp/task-resid/`, never synced anywhere; the gate itself unmodified apart from a dump
of the log), chromium/`owrt2512b` `@390 top normal` `/admin/network/dhcp` — the cheapest cell of the
finding, which reproduces on demand: `3x repeat 0px/-47px/-47px`.

| what | number (`../tmp/task-resid/dbg-before.json`) |
|---|---|
| `holdFloor()` sweeps in the run | 38 |
| of those, document shorter between the clear and the write-back | 33 |
| of those, the offset went down with it | 13 |
| … the document came back and the offset did not (this fault) | 8 |
| … the document stayed shorter, a real shrink clamped for real | 5 |
| sweeps that moved the offset UP | 0 |
| corrections `lateDrift()` then refused as "the reader is moving" | 6 |

The other five are the opposite case and belong to the shrink rather than to this pass: the offset
went 3958 to 3886 with the document staying **120px shorter for good**, a real clamp into real
lost height, which `lateDrift()`'s `floorShrink` path corrects. Restoring unconditionally would take
those five as well, which is why the restore is gated on the scroller being as tall again as it was.

The eight are the unscoped, every-box sweep `sampleMotion()` runs when the reader is judged still:
33 boxes cleared at once, document 4730px → **4729px** → 4730px, offset 3886 → **3885** → 3885. The
floors go back and the document with them; the offset does not. `holdFloor()` clears every floor
before it measures — that clear is what makes the answers honest (anchoring.md) — and for the length
of the measure pass the document stands without them, one pixel short of what the reader's offset
needs. The clamp that costs is the floor's own.

**One pixel, and then 59.** `lateDrift()` reads the offset twice, `SCROLL_IDLE` apart, and treats any
difference as the reader having moved (`scrollTop() !== seen`). The sweep landed six milliseconds
before that second read, so the tick's own shrink correction — 60px, already computed — was thrown
away as "the reader is moving" (`late-refuse why: moving, seen 3886, now 3885`), and the unforced
`rememberRest()` a millisecond later adopted 3885 as the reference the NEXT refill measures against.
The next refill then measured `drift 10.63` off that wrong ground and wrote `4017`: the reader's own
mark at -47px, `corrected: never`, `engineTrusted` true throughout — the finding, end to end, with no
step in it that anything before this task could see.

**The fix is in `holdFloor()`: it puts back the offset its own pass took.** The offset is read before
the clear, and the scroller's height with it; after the write-back, where the offset is lower AND the
scroller is as tall again as it was, the pre-sweep offset is written back through `writeOffset()` —
the same door both corrections use, so the motion sampler reads the restore as this file's own
(`sawOwnWrite()`) rather than as the reader arriving. Nothing in the function is asynchronous and
`scrolling()` at its top already refused a moving reader, so an offset that is lower at the end than
at the start was lowered by this pass and by nothing else.

**Two forms were measured; the narrow one shipped.** Restoring unconditionally — no height test, the
browser's own clamp doing the separating, since a write above the maximum lands back on the pixel it
already stands on — is green on this cell too, and 70 B cheaper minified (`fs-fit.js` 8202 B at HEAD,
8238 B unconditional, 8308 B as shipped). It also turns every genuine
floor-shrink clamp into this file's own write, so the motion window that clamp used to open stops
opening and `sampleMotion()`'s terminal sweep stops running behind it: a change to what `scrolling()`
answers for the whole theme, on a path this task measured one cell of. `scrolling()`'s own contract is
"the page is moving, whoever moves it", and the height test holds the cell on its own, so the wider
form does not ship.

**Proof.** The real gate, against the working tree synced to the stand (`owlab sync owrt2512b`), the
same cell: `3x repeat 0px/0px/0px`, `trusted true->true`, no finding — where the same command on the
same stand read `refill 2/3 … -47px off (engineTrusted true, corrected never) — writes:
[{"how":"window.scrollTo","val":4017}]` before it. `SWAP`'s own floor-only ablation on that cell moved
with it, `clamped -59px, reader -47px` → `clamped 0px, reader 1px`. `tools/floor-contract.mjs`
(`owrt2512b`, the gate `js.md` names for anything in `holdFloor()`): 62 floors, worst -1px against the
box, 4 released after emptying, 3 on a tab switch, 5 partial shrinks — unmoved.

**And the sweep around it.** `--only owrt2512b,owrt2410b,owrtsnapb --engines chromium,firefox,webkit`,
default axes, all three pages: **no `REPEAT` position finding anywhere** — not one refill left the
reader outside tolerance on any engine, stand or page. The single finding the run does carry is
`webkit owrt2410b @390 top normal overview: _engineTrusted went false after 3 refills the reader never
moved for (misses: [true,true,false])` — the same cell, the same shape and the same reader-holds-at-0px
reading task wkrefill's own Proof already recorded as pre-existing and separate. Untouched here; the
cause is measured in the next section, and it is not the miss-count asymmetry both earlier sections
guessed at.

**Cost:** +106 B minified. `coldJs` 60,400 → 60,550 and `resourcesJs` 95,300 → 95,400
(`tools/size-budget.mjs`, each with the note the raise is written against); the unconditional form's
+36 B fits inside both, and is the only reason the choice above is a trade rather than a preference.


## The theme's own floor write is what the engine declines for — disproven


The residual the section above leaves — `webkit owrt2410b @390 top normal overview: _engineTrusted
went false after 3 refills the reader never moved for (misses: [true,true,false])` — is not the
asymmetry task wkrefill and task nine both guessed at. **The two misses are counted for refills the
engine really did decline; what makes it decline is this file's own `min-height` write, and no
narrow rule separating that from a real decline was found. Nothing shipped. Read this before trying
the miss-count again.**

**The second half of that sentence is wrong, and task decline below has the numbers** — the finding
reproduces verbatim against a build with `holdFloor()` deleted from `run()`, and the ablation this
section rests on does not re-measure the same (10 of 14 against 7, not 13 against 8). The misses
themselves are real and everything measured about them here still holds; only the cause named in
the heading does not.

**The hypothesis on this page until now, disproven.** Both earlier sections named it the same way:
"the miss count never cross-checks `compensated` when `drift` reads large rather than near-zero".
Instrumented through the real gate's own code (`../tmp/task-close/`, scratch, never committed and
never synced to a stand: an instrumented `fs-fit.js` served by route interception, and a copy of
`tools/scroll-anchor.mjs` carrying that route plus a log dump — the gate in the tree is untouched,
and reproduces the finding by itself), the two counted misses read
`drift 120, grow 120, compensated 0` — the cross-check the hypothesis asks for gives ZERO, which is
"the engine never touched the offset", the one case that IS a miss. The offset stood at 6518 through
a 120px growth entirely above the reader, and the mark held only because `lateDrift()` wrote the
120px itself (`out=write/miss`, `wrote 6638`). The gate's own finding text — "the engine was
anchoring correctly the whole time" — is its inference from the reader not moving, and the reader
not moving is the theme's correction, not the engine's.

**What the engine is actually doing, measured against the theme with its correction off**
(`../tmp/task-close/probe2.mjs`, `fsAnchor=off` so the floors and the observer still run and no
scroll write in the window is the theme's; a 120px pad appended above the fold, 14 add/remove cycles,
`owrt2410b`/webkit `@390 top`): the engine anchors **every other cycle**, `moved 136 / 0 / 136 / 0 …`,
and the alternation is indifferent to a programmatic scroll before the mutation — the delays 0, 30,
100, 300, 600 and 1200ms and the no-scroll control all sit on the same alternating sequence. It is
not a suppression window after a scroll write, which is what the instrumented gate run made it look
like.

**The ablation that names the cause.** The same probe against a copy whose `holdFloor()` returns at
its first line — no floors written at all, everything else identical: **13 of 14 cycles anchored**
(`moved 136`, one 198, one 0) against 8 of 14 with the floors on. The `min-height` clear-and-rewrite
this file performs on every `run()` is what costs the engine its adjustment, on roughly half the
refills, on this page — `holdFloor()`'s own citation for why that write is a scroll-anchor
invalidation (css-scroll-anchoring-1 §2.2.2) reaching the growth side, where only the SHRINK side is
excused today (`floorShrink > 1`, task refill2). `owrt2512b` on the same engine and width reads
`compensated 120` on every refill of the same case, with no theme write anywhere in the run: the
same code, a different page, and the invalidating write does not coincide with the growth there.

**Why nothing shipped.** The obvious rule — do not count a miss on a tick this file rewrote a floor
in — is not narrow, it is unconditional: every `run()` sweeps, so the counter would never fire again
and `_engineTrusted` could never move, which is `LATE_MISS_LIMIT`'s whole purpose. Nothing measured
here separates the half that suppresses from the half that does not: the floor is written on every
cycle and the engine anchors on half of them, so "a floor was written" is not the discriminator, and
neither is "the floor's value changed" (it grows by the pad on both stands, and `owrt2512b` anchors
anyway). Raising `LATE_MISS_LIMIT` to 3 is tuning a threshold for green and was not tried. The one
direction not yet measured is making the sweep stop clearing a box whose floor it is about to write
back unchanged — that touches the "cleared and re-measured, not read off the content" contract six
measured failures stand behind (anchoring.md), and holding it needs the whole sweep, not one cell.

**Impact while it stands.** The reader does not move on this cell — `3x repeat 0px/0px/0px` — because
the fast path takes over and corrects. What the flip costs is the guarantee `ENGINE_ANCHORS` exists
for: `anchorFor()`/`scheduleAnchor()` running beside an engine that anchors the OTHER half of the
refills, which is the "two corrections throw the page the other way" configuration. It has been
measured not to throw the reader on this cell, and only on this cell.


## A clamp is not the reader


The last cell CI failed on — `webkit owrtsnap @1440 side compact overview`, engine-anchoring on, run
34483363796 — carried two findings, and only ONE of them was the reader ending up in the wrong place:
`3x repeat 0px/-60px/-60px`, `refill 2/3 … left the reader -60px off (engineTrusted true, corrected
never)`, with a write of its own recorded in the window. That is this section. The other finding is
the `419ms` one, and it is still open — the last paragraph here says what it is and what it is not.

**The cell is `.fs-main`, not the window**, which is why 28788d0 did not reach it: every cell that
commit closed scrolled the document. Nothing about the inner scroller turned out to matter, though —
the fault below is the same on either, and it was reproduced on this one because this is the one CI
named.

**Reproduced, and the reproduction is the useful half.** The cell is green on demand locally: WebKit's
own anchoring works there, so the theme is never the corrector and there is nothing to get wrong (3
runs, `3x repeat 0px/0px/0px`, `corrected 16ms`). What CI has that a fast machine does not is an
engine that DECLINES on this cell — so the engine's own anchoring was ablated away with
`overflow-anchor: none` and NOTHING else (task latenet's own SWAP ablation: the theme still believes
the platform anchors, `fsEngineAnchor` untouched), and both CI findings appeared verbatim, first try:
`3x repeat 0px/-60px/-60px`, `corrected 419ms`. Scratch, never synced anywhere and not committed
(`../tmp/task-wk1440/`): an instrumented `fs-fit.js` served by route interception, plus a copy of
`tools/scroll-anchor.mjs` carrying that route and the ablation — the gate in the tree is untouched
and reproduces nothing by itself here.

**What the instrumented run shows, and it is not the refill.** The -60px is made between two refills,
by the pad coming OFF:

| what | number (`../tmp/task-wk1440/dbg-*.json`) |
|---|---|
| the scroller when the 120px pad is removed above the reader | 2793 → **2673px** |
| where the browser's clamp put the offset | 1889 → **1829** |
| where the reader needed it | **1769** |
| `applyAnchor()` one frame later | `scrolling true, moving 400ms, at 1829` — refused |
| the correction it was holding | `drift -60`, never written |
| what `rememberRest()` then adopted | 1829, `_rest.top` -362.625 → **-422.625** |

A clamp gives back only what the document lost at its BOTTOM. A 120px shrink ABOVE the reader needs
120px of offset; the bottom had 60px to give, so the clamp took 60 and the reader was left 60px short
— and `applyAnchor()`, the one thing that puts back the rest, refuses while `scrolling()`, which the
clamp's own `scroll` event had just made true 11ms earlier. **The very trap `settleDeferredFloor()`'s
own third attempt already fell into once** ("gating on `scrolling()` refuses on the very motion it is
trying to observe"), on a different path, in the one guard nobody had re-read for it. From there the
terminal sweep's `rememberRest()` re-took the reference AT 1829, and every refill afterwards measured
a textbook 0px of drift against ground that was already 60px wrong: `refill 2/3 … corrected never`,
`engineTrusted` saying nothing, no step in it visible to the gate.

**The fix is one pixel, recorded where the clamp is already watched.** `holdFloor()` reads the offset
and the scroller's height before its clear and again after the write-back — task resid's own
measurement — and it already separates its own transient dip (`scrollHeight` back where it was, the
offset restored) from a real shrink (`scrollHeight` still shorter). That second branch did nothing
until now; it now records the PIXEL the clamp landed on, and `applyAnchor()` treats `scrolling()` as
not blocking while the offset is still standing on it. Read back with the identical `scrollTop() !==
seen` shape `lateDrift()` asks of its own offset, so the mark stands only while nothing has moved: a
reader who really is scrolling has left that pixel by definition, which is what keeps this to one
case.

**NOT a second `_ownWrite`, and that is the whole difference from the form task resid declined.**
`scrolling()` is untouched: it keeps answering "the page is moving, whoever moves it" for the whole
theme, the motion window a real clamp opens still opens, and `sampleMotion()`'s terminal sweep still
runs behind it. The new marker answers one narrower question, for `applyAnchor()` alone — is the
motion blocking this correction the clamp the correction is FOR?

**Proof, the same rig.** `clamp-mark 1829` → `saw-clamp mark 1829 now 1829` → `apply-in drift -60` →
`apply-write to 1769`, and the reference stays honest (`_rest.top` -362.625 throughout). `3x repeat
0px/0px/0px`, corrected 34/23/23ms where it read 0/-60/-60 and `corrected never` before. The NEXT pad
removal then clamps nothing at all (`at 1769, landed 1769`): with the offset already where the reader
belongs, there is no clamp left to make. `tools/floor-contract.mjs` — the gate `js.md` names for
anything in `holdFloor()` — over all three twins: 175 floors, worst -1px against the box, 12 released
after emptying, 9 on a tab switch, 3 folds closed, 3 `depends()` rows, 15 partial shrinks; unmoved.

**And the sweep around it.** Before, on the three twins with the tree at HEAD: `--engines webkit
--full`, 181 cells measured, **3 findings**. After, the same twins with the fix synced and all three
engines this time: `--engines chromium,firefox,webkit --full`, **552 cells measured, 2 findings** —
both of them ones the before run also carries (`webkit owrt2410b @390 top normal overview:
_engineTrusted went false after 3 refills the reader never moved for`, task close's own open cell, and
`webkit owrtsnapb @390 side normal /admin/network/dhcp: refill 2/3 … -49px … corrected never`, a
window-scroller shape with THREE `window.scrollTo` writes in its window rather than this fault's one,
present identically before and after and absent from CI's own run of the same axes). Nothing new on
chromium or firefox, nothing new on any window-scrolling cell, `mid-flick surprises 0` on all 552 —
which is the regression this change had to be measured against, since it lets `applyAnchor()` run
while `scrolling()` reads true. The third before-finding (the owrt2512b twin of that same dhcp shape)
did not reappear; one pass is not enough to call it closed, and nothing here was aimed at it.

**Cost:** +53 B minified (`fs-fit.js` 8308 → 8361 B). `tools/size-budget.mjs` is unchanged and green
— shipped JS 93.1 → 93.2 KB against a 95400 B budget.

**What this does NOT close, measured.** The cell's other finding — `a section was refilled … and the
correction landed 419ms after the refill` — survives the fix, and it is not this fault: with the
engine ablated off, `lateDrift()` is the only corrector for the first two refills of a page and it
answers one rAF plus `SCROLL_IDLE` later BY CONSTRUCTION (task latenet measured that path at
419-420ms and picked `LATE_MS` to sit between it and the fast path's 7-36ms). The trace is
unambiguous: HOLD's own pad is miss 1, SWAP's refill is miss 2 and is corrected late, `_engineTrusted`
goes false immediately after it, and every refill from there is corrected at 23-34ms
(`3x repeat 0px/0px/0px`, `trusted false->false`). Closing it means one of two things, neither of them
this task's: stopping the engine from declining in the first place — which task decline below
measured is NOT the theme's `min-height` write — or letting the switch trip on the FIRST refill the
engine provably did
nothing for, which is `LATE_MISS_LIMIT`'s headroom and a threshold, not a cause. **The first of the
two is what task fourevents closed** (below): the engine stopped declining, so the cell reads
`corrected 30ms` and there is no late correction left to report.


## The floor write is not what the engine declines for


The section above and task close between them left one cause standing for both open cells: the
theme's own `min-height` clear-and-rewrite. **It is not the cause. Measured four ways, including
against a build with `holdFloor()` deleted from `run()`, which reproduces the finding verbatim.**
Nothing shipped; `fs-fit.js` is untouched. Read this before trying the floor write again.

**The reproduction, with the number task close's own run never recorded.**
`../tmp/task-decline/real-probe.mjs` (scratch, never committed, never synced to a stand) repeats task
close's shape exactly — `owrt2410b`/webkit `@390 top normal`, `/admin/status/overview`,
`fsAnchor=off` so no scroll write in the window is a correction of the theme's, a 120px pad appended
above the fold and taken off again, 14 cycles — and adds `document.scrollHeight` beside the offset:
`moved 136/0/136/0…` as before, and `grew 136` on **every one of the 14**. The zeroes are real
declines, not cycles where the growth never reached the scroller. Task close's ablation itself does
not re-measure the same, though: rebuilt from the same HEAD, `holdFloor()` returning at its first
line reads **10 of 14** against **7 of 14** with the floors live — not 13 against 8 — and the
no-floor half is not stable across runs (9/12 and 10/12 on two more).

**Four builds that differ ONLY inside `holdFloor()`'s clear/measure/write step**
(`../tmp/task-decline/mkvar.mjs`, each served by route interception over the real stand; every
guard, the box list, the dirty filter and the clamp branch byte-identical to the tree), 12 cycles
each on that cell:

| build | what changed in the step | anchored |
|---|---|---|
| head | — | 6/12 |
| samequiet | the declaration re-issued only where the value changed, the clear kept | 6/12 |
| f1 | the step skipped in the mutation's own turn (`dirty` narrowed from "under a mutated element" to "just inserted") | 6/12 |
| noclear | the clear dropped, the height measured with the floor standing | 12/12 |

Re-issuing the declaration is not the trigger — `samequiet` is head to the cycle. Not performing the
step at all in the mutation's turn is not it either — `f1` is head to the cycle, with `holdFloor()`
logging `nodirty` on all 12. The one build that moves the answer is the one that stops the floor
coming down, and the gate says what that costs on the same cell: `noclear` reads `the 120px pad only
grew the document 1px … the growth never reached the scroller` and `floor alone: clamped -120px,
reader 0px`. Its 12/12 is measured on a page whose document no longer shrinks, not on this one.

**And the finding survives `holdFloor()` being deleted outright.** `var-nohold.js` — `run()`'s
`holdFloor(records)` line removed, nothing else — served through a copy of the gate
(`../tmp/task-decline/patch-gate.mjs`; `tools/scroll-anchor.mjs` in the tree is untouched and
reproduces the finding by itself): `webkit owrt2410b @390 top normal engine-anchoring on overview:
_engineTrusted went false after 3 refills the reader never moved for (misses: [true,true,false])`,
`3x repeat 0px/0px/-1px`, `trusted true->false`. Verbatim, floors or no floors.

**The theme is still in the loop, though.** With every fitter off as well (`fsFit=off` plus
`fsAnchor=off`, so nothing of this file runs) the same pad cycle on the same cell anchors **20 of
20** across five scroll shapes — nothing before the growth, a same-value `scrollTo`, a 2px kick and
back, a 2px kick left standing, a kick 1400ms early — and **12 of 12** across a shrink parked where
the clamp bites and one parked where it does not (`scroll-probe.mjs`, `clamp-probe.mjs`). The engine
declines nothing when the theme does nothing.

**Where the two misses actually come from.** Instrumented through the real gate
(`../tmp/task-decline/mkdbg2.mjs`, every site `_lateMisses` can move plus `holdFloor()`'s own step
and `writeOffset()`), `REPEAT`'s three refills of one section, `grewDoc 120` throughout:

| refill | what preceded it | `lateDrift()` | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3.8s of a still page | `drift 0, grow 120, compensated 120` | `corrected 16ms`, `writes []` — the engine did it |
| 2 | the pad off 277ms earlier | `drift 120, grow 120, compensated 0` | `corrected 428ms`, one `window.scrollTo`, miss 1 |
| 3 | the pad off 401ms earlier | `drift 120, grow 120, compensated 0` | `corrected 428ms`, one `window.scrollTo`, miss 2 → `_engineTrusted` false |

The pad coming off is four events, not one: the unscoped sweep takes the floor back down
(`DIV 1945px>1825px`), the document goes 7542 → 7422, the browser's own clamp takes the offset
6638 → 6578, `holdFloor()`'s 1px restore writes 6577, and the theme writes 6518 for the 60px the
clamp could not give back. The growth that follows reads `compensated 0` — the offset never moved at
all — so the miss is honest arithmetic and the engine really did decline. **Which of those four
costs it the adjustment is not measured, and is the open question this task hands on** — answered
below, task fourevents: neither of the theme's two writes, and the clamp only because the theme's
own sweep is what makes one. The 419ms of the other open cell is this 428ms: one `lateDrift()`
correction, on the refill after a shrink.

**A direct test of §2.2.2 that reproduced nothing, recorded so the next session does not repeat it.**
`../tmp/task-decline/spec-probe.mjs` floors the theme's own box list by hand with the theme off and
performs the same clear-and-rewrite in the mutation's own turn — on the box holding the fold's hit
test (on the path from the anchor to the scroller), on every box, on a box that is not on that path,
the same declaration re-issued with no computed change, a +1px change with no clear in front of it,
and the whole churn one rendering update later. All eight arms read 3/3 anchored, three repeats. It
is recorded as a rig that never reached the fault, not as evidence about the property.


## The floor is written half a pixel too tall


The four events task decline left undivided are divided here, and the answer is none of the two the
theme writes. **`offsetHeight` is an integer. Every floor is therefore written up to half a pixel
TALLER than the content it was measured from, the clear at the top of the next sweep hands those
pixels back, and a reader parked at the end of the document has the offset clamped into the gap.**
That clamp is a scroll position change, and a scroll position change invalidates the engine's own
anchor node — css-scroll-anchoring-1 §2.1.1, verbatim: an anchor node becomes invalid when "the
scroll position of the scrolling box changes (excluding adjustments originating from scroll
anchoring)". The growth that arrives next is then left uncorrected, which is the `compensated 0`
task decline measured and read as the engine declining. It is the engine declining; this is why.

**The rounding, read off the boxes themselves** (`../tmp/task-fourevents/`, the `dip` build: the
document's own height logged between the clear pass and the write-back, each box's `offsetHeight`
beside its fractional rect height, same cell). Written back / measured with the floor cleared:
`422 / 421.875`, `41 / 40.75`, `293 / 292.719`, `476 / 475.531`, `1686 / 1685.656`, `270 / 269.969`
— twenty-two boxes, and the document stands **2px taller with the floors than without them**:
`7422 → 7420` on 57 of the run's 64 sweeps. The one-pixel dip task resid measured and wrote back
(`4730 → 4729 → 4730`) is the same arithmetic, one box's worth.

**The separation.** Every row is `owrt2410b`/webkit `@390 top normal` `/admin/status/overview`,
`fsAnchor=off`, 12 cycles of a 120px pad appended above the fold and taken off again, each build
differing from the tree in ONE place (`../tmp/task-fourevents/mkvar4*.mjs`, route-interception over
the real stand, the gate untouched). `clamp force` takes the offset to the scroller's maximum before
the pad comes off so EVERY cycle clamps — task decline's own shape could not, because only a cycle
the engine anchored ends far enough down to clamp, which confounds the clamp with the outcome:

| build | what it takes out | anchored |
|---|---|---|
| head, task decline's shape | — | 6/12 |
| head, clamp forced on every cycle | the confound | 6/12 |
| head, the offset put back before the pad comes off | **event 2, the clamp** | **12/12** |
| `fsFit=off` + `fsAnchor=off`, clamp forced | the whole theme | **12/12** |
| `norestore`, clamp forced | **event 3**, `holdFloor()`'s own restore write | 6/12 |
| `neither`, clamp forced | **events 3 and 4**, both theme writes | 6/12 |
| `samepixel`, clamp forced | the write's PIXEL, keeping the call | 6/12 |
| `nohold` | `holdFloor()` out of `run()` | 6/12 |
| `norem` | `rememberRest()` out of `run()` | 6/12 |
| `nomo` | the growth witness's own read | 6/12 |
| `nofloor` | `holdFloor()` returning at its first line | 8/12 |
| `nosample` | the motion sampler's own unscoped sweep | **12/12** |
| `nofit` | `runAll(_fitters)` out of `run()` | **12/12** |
| `fracfloor` | **the floor written at the box's own height** | **12/12** |

**Event 1 (the sweep lowering a floor) and event 2 (the clamp) are not separable, and that is the
finding**: the clamp is what the sweep's own rounding makes. A clamp with the theme out of the loop
is harmless (12/12, and task decline's `clamp-probe` already read 12/12 for the same shape); the
sweep with the offset 60px clear of the document's end is harmless (12/12); the two together are the
fault. Events 3 and 4 are cleared outright — removing either, both, or the pixel the restore writes
while keeping the call, all read 6/12, unchanged.

**It takes two, and only one of them is this file's.** `nofit` reads 12/12 with the dip and the
restore write both still happening, and every single fitter removed on its own does the same —
`fitChrome` unregistered 12/12, `fs-select`'s six passes unregistered 12/12, `fitChrome()` returning
after `fitShell()` 12/12, `fitChrome()`'s bar pin alone removed 10/12 (`../tmp/task-fourevents/`,
phase D). So the decline needs the engine's anchor to have been invalidated AND a fitter's own
synchronous pass in the next mutation's turn; the theme owns both halves, and the half that can be
fixed without giving up a measured mechanism is the invalidation. **The fitter half is not chased
here and is not a finding against any one fitter** — every arm above removes a pass that exists for
a measured reason (task barpin, `docs/chrome.md`), and nothing here says which style write inside it
is the suppression trigger.

**The fix is the measurement, not a rule**: the floor is written at `getBoundingClientRect().height`
instead of `offsetHeight`, so it never stands taller than the content and clearing it cannot shorten
the document. Same forced layout, same line, no new read. The one place the two genuinely differ is
a TRANSFORMED box, where the rect is the painted size and a floor wants the layout size — none of
the theme's own `transform` rules is on a floored container (a spinner, a rail-toggle glyph, the nav
progress bar, `fs-fade`'s 4px rise), and a scale on one would be an app's own doing.
`grew` (the mutation callback's growth witness) still reads `offsetHeight` against a now-fractional
floor: up to half a pixel of disagreement, against a `grow > 1` guard and a 16px
`LATE_ROUND_TOLERANCE`, and not worth the bytes to make exact.

**Proof, the probe.** The tree's own file against `HEAD`'s, same cell, 14 cycles, both shapes:
`HEAD 7/14` (`136,0,136,0…`, the alternation) against **`14/14`** with the fix, on `clamp force` and
on `clamp auto` alike; head's alternation reproduced on four separate runs and the fix's 14/14 on
four. **How many cycles are enough:** head's is a DETERMINISTIC alternation, so 12 settles it
(P(12 of 12 | p = 0.5) = 2.4e-4); an arm that is merely better is a different question — separating
p = 0.8 from p = 1.0 at 95% needs 14 cycles, which is why task decline's `13/14 against 8/14` did
not re-measure and why `nofloor`'s 8/12 above is reported as "not clean" rather than as a number.

**Proof, the real gate, and it closes BOTH open cells.** `tools/scroll-anchor.mjs` against the
working tree synced to the twins, on the cell task close and task decline both ended at —
`webkit owrt2410b @390 top normal /admin/status/overview`, engine-anchoring on:
`3x repeat 0px/0px/0px`, **`trusted true->true`**, `swap moved 0px [offset +120]`, `corrected 30ms`,
`tick drift 0px/4mut`, `mid-flick surprises 0`, no finding — where the same command on the same
stand read `_engineTrusted went false after 3 refills the reader never moved for (misses:
[true,true,false])` before. The other open finding goes with it: `corrected 30ms` is the engine
doing the refill itself, not `lateDrift()` doing it 419-428ms late, so there is no late correction
left to report. The engine-anchoring-OFF half of the same cell is unmoved (`reader moved 0px`,
`corrected 54ms`, the theme's own path, which this change does not touch).

The second cell the wk1440 sweep carried — `webkit owrtsnapb @390 side normal /admin/network/dhcp`,
`refill 2/3 … -49px … corrected never`, three `window.scrollTo` writes in its window — reads
`3x repeat 0px/0px/0px`, `trusted true->true`, `corrected 16ms`, `mid-flick surprises 0`, no
finding, on the same run.

**`tools/floor-contract.mjs`** — the gate `js.md` names for anything in `holdFloor()` — over all
three twins: **175 floors, worst 0px against the box**, 12 released after emptying, 9 on a tab
switch, 3 folds closed, 3 `depends()` rows, 15 partial shrinks. Every count is task wk1440's own
recorded run to the number, and the one that moved is the point: **worst −1px → 0px**. That is the
same half-pixel, measured from the other side — a floor that no longer stands taller than the box
it was taken from. The floors it prints are fractional now (`638.656px → 338.75px over 339px of
box`, `1094.41px → 951.875px`), which is what a floor written at the height actually measured looks
like.

**And the sweep around it.** `--full` over the three twins, **one engine at a time**: chromium
**184 runs, 0 findings**; firefox **184 runs, 0 findings**; webkit 184 runs, 8 findings, none of
which repeats. Six of the eight are the gate's own `the measurement threw — fs-fit is loaded but
exports no engineTrusted()` and two are `owrt2512b @1440 side normal`, engine-anchoring OFF, `the
page never came back … writes: []` — all eight on the same router, on the pass that started while
the machine was still busy with the crashed three-engine run below. Both shapes are gone twice
over: re-measured cell by cell with the fix and `HEAD` back to back on that box
(`../tmp/task-fourevents/runI.sh`, an `owlab sync` between the two) both cells read clean on BOTH
builds, three passes; and **a second full webkit pass reads 184 runs, 0 findings**. `mid-flick
surprises 0` on all 736 runs, which is the regression this change had to be measured against: it
moves what every floor in the tree is written at, on every page.

**A run of all three engines at once does not survive on this machine, and that is the stand, not
the theme.** Nine browser contexts against three routers took chromium's own process down after
~2 minutes (`browserContext.close: Target page, context or browser has been closed`, the zygote
socket closed, `Failed to send GetTerminationStatus message to zygote`) with 37 clean cells already
printed. One `--engines` at a time completes. Belongs in development.md's "The stand's own traps";
that file was another task's this session and is not touched here.

**Cost: +18 B minified** (`fs-fit.js` 8361 → 8379 B), and it does not fit: shipped JS 95,394 →
95,412 B against `tools/size-budget.mjs`'s 95,400 B `resourcesJs` limit, **12 B over**, with
`coldJs` unmoved at 59.1 KB against 60,550. The budget's own rule is that the number is raised by
the maintainer with the note saying what it bought; this task did not raise it, and `npm run check`
is red on that line until it is.


## The floor's shape, and the revert that produced it

The shape is 0.14.3's again: every floor is cleared, the box re-measured with `offsetHeight`, and
the floor written back where that answer is above zero. 0.14.4-0.14.6 replaced the clear with a
reader over the content (`naturalHeight()`), and then spent three more mechanisms repairing what
that reader got wrong on a hidden pane, on a box that ends in text and on a container that empties
for good. Each of those was measured and each worked; together they were a floor whose value
depended on four decisions taken in the same pass, and the releases carrying them are the ones the
reports are about. The clear costs a forced layout per box per pass and answers 0 for anything the
page is not showing, which is the answer all four repairs were reconstructing.

What stayed out of the revert is the floor's own bookkeeping. Six things are load-bearing, and each
was a measured failure first:


## A tab switch moves no node

**A tab switch has to wake the sweep.** Clearing a floor at the next pass is not clearing it:
a tab switch moves no node — `ui.tabs` writes `data-tab-active` on the panes — so the
`{childList, subtree}` observer on `#view` never fires, and `min-height` beats the `height: 0` an
inactive pane is collapsed with. The pane the reader left keeps the height it had while it was
open and the tab they opened starts below it. On a page that polls that lasts one `pollinterval`,
which is the "it puts itself right after a few seconds" in the reports; on a page that does not
poll, the life of the page. Measured on 25.12 at 1440px: System → Startup left 2432px of floor on
`Initscripts`, the document at 3304px and the "Local Startup" textarea 2716px down — read as a
missing textarea (#75, and forum post 68 against 0.14.4); Network → Interfaces left 1299px, the
document at 2647px against 1720. A third MutationObserver, filtered to `data-tab-active`, runs the
same sweep at the switch. It calls `run()` rather than going through the observer that carries the
anchoring corrections — those answer a poll tick that moved the page under a still reader, and a
tab the reader clicked is neither. Whether the blank is ever SEEN is release-dependent and the
mechanism is not: on the 24.10 stand the same v0.14.6 build cleared both floors within 200 ms of
the switch, something else in that luci-base having mutated `#view`.

## A fold and a depends() row move no node either

**Hiding content IN PLACE has to wake the sweep too, not only a tab strip.**
`fs-appearance.js`'s `foldable()` OPENS a disclosure by mutating nodes (`refreshColours()`, a
childList change the first observer already sees) but CLOSES it by writing `hidden` on the panel
and `aria-expanded` on the button only — the same asymmetry as a tab pane, one level down, and it
is why the floor only ever grows: /admin/system/footstrap, "Colours", measured 731px before
opening, 1485px open, and STAYED at 1485px after closing again, 754px of empty ground still there
21s later on a page that never polls (`../tmp/task-spoilerfloor`); "Background" has the same shape
at 55px held. **Stock LuCI has it too, wider than the theme:** `form.js`'s `setActive()` — what
every `depends()` calls — hides a row by toggling the CLASS `hidden` on the `[data-field]` element,
not the attribute, so it wakes nothing that watches attributes alone. System → System, Time
Synchronization, unticking "Enable NTP client": 308px of floor held against a 50px bare section,
258px of empty ground, unchanged 10s later. `_moTabs` closes both, rather than a fourth
`MutationObserver` instance: one more registration on the SAME node replaces the one before it, so
`data-tab-active` grows into `attributeFilter: ['data-tab-active', 'hidden', 'aria-expanded',
'class']` on the same call, over the same two hosts, instead of paying for a second instance and a
second `for` loop over `hosts` — measured at 108 B less minified than a separate observer wired the
same way. `hidden` and `aria-expanded` are cheap to watch across the whole subtree — nothing
rewrites them on a poll tick — but **`class` is not**: `_moFlag`'s own comment is why watching it
unfiltered would call `run()` on every row a tick rewrites. So a `class` record only wakes the
sweep where the mutated element itself carries `data-field` (`r.target.dataset.field`, cheaper
minified than `hasAttribute()` and just as correct — the value is a cbid, never empty where the
attribute is present) — once per delivered record, a property read with no forced layout, not once
per poll tick — and `hidden`/`aria-expanded`/`data-tab-active` records wake it unconditionally.
`tools/floor-contract.mjs` gained the two triggers this needs (a disclosure open-then-close, a
`depends()` row switched off) — its ACCURACY check already caught the discrepancy outright once
something exercised it. Cost: 82 B minified over `tools/size-budget.mjs`'s `coldJs` limit (45 B of
head-room before this fix), the array and the filter both irreducible without dropping coverage —
reported rather than raised, per the budget's own rule.

## A same-value class write is a feedback loop

**That `class` watch is a feedback loop unless a write that changed nothing is discarded — task
freeze.** The `data-field` guard above bounds WHICH elements a `class` record may wake the
sweep from; it says nothing about WHO wrote it, and the sweep's own fitters write `class` on every
pass by design — `fs-select.js`'s `adoptMarkup()` re-applies `.th`/`.tr`/`.td` to a polled table's
fresh rows, "additive only and cheap to re-run every pass". `classList.add()` of a token that is
already there still WRITES the attribute, and a same-value attribute write still queues a mutation
record (the trap `fs-chrome.js` names for `setAttribute`, one `toggleAttribute` away there). Put
`data-field` on a table cell — markup any app may ship, and `luci-app-filemanager` puts it on every
`<th>` — and the loop closes: the sweep writes, the observer wakes, the sweep writes again, and the
microtask queue never drains. Measured on `owrt2512b`, /admin/system/filemanager, every
`MutationObserver` on the page instrumented (`../tmp/task-freeze/mo-probe.mjs`): **391 callbacks in
432 ms — 926 a second, and only because the probe's own budget stopped it — 3910 records, every one
of them `class`, every one written from inside the previous callback by
`tagDataTables`/`adoptMarkup`/`fitTables`, 2340 of them on the same six `th[data-field]`.** The tab
does not come back; the renderer sits at ~105% CPU for as long as it is open, `evaluate` never
returns against the 4 ms the stock `/luci-static/bootstrap` theme answers in, and every gate that
walked this router's menu quietly recorded "no shape" for the page. So `_moTabs` compares
`oldValue` against what the attribute reads NOW and drops the record where they agree: same page,
**2 callbacks, 20 records, 0 of them reaching `run()`**. The VALUE, not a flag and not
`takeRecords()` after the sweep — a flag cannot work, since delivery is a microtask that runs after
`run()` has returned, and draining the queue also drops what an external writer had queued and not
yet been delivered for, which on one task that both refills a section and re-runs `depends()` is a
real hide this observer exists to catch. Nothing the two cases above buy is given up, because a
real change changes the value: /admin/system/footstrap "Colours" still measures 731 / 1485 / 731px
open-close-settled with `HELD=0px`, and Time Synchronization's section floor still comes down 307.5
→ 49.5px against a 50px bare box the moment the `depends()` row hides (`HELD=0px`, both on
`owrt2512b`, `../tmp/task-spoilerfloor/probe.mjs` and `probe3.mjs`). `tools/floor-contract.mjs`
gained the case: /admin/system/filemanager is now one of its pages, and the first question it asks
of every page is whether the main thread still answers — a frozen one used to read there as a page
with no floors, and now it is a finding.

## A box nothing touched must not be re-cleared

**A box nothing touched must not be re-cleared at all — task floorchurn.** Every one of the six
points in [anchoring.md](anchoring.md), "The document may not get shorter", assumes the clear-and-remeasure pass is the cost of correctness; it is also, on its
own, a cost worth not paying twice. Instrumented across 25s of real polling on the Overview, three
routers whose poll delivers System/Memory/Storage as separate `MutationObserver` batches (`owrt2512`,
`owrtsnap`, `imm2512`): 25 `holdFloor()` calls (5 per tick) times up to 29 candidate boxes is 725
clears and 625 writes, and 610 of those 625 write back the value already standing — only 15 boxes
ever actually change (`../tmp/task-floorsuppress/`). A box no mutation touched cannot have a
different true content height from the one this function measured it at last time — the only other
thing that changes what a box's content needs is a WIDTH change, which is a different codepath
entirely (`onResize()` → `schedule()` → `run()` with no records, still an unscoped sweep). So
`holdFloor()` now takes the mutation observer's own `records` and narrows the clear/measure/write
step to the boxes at least one record's `target` actually touched, either direction (a box may be
the target itself, contain it, or — a fresh child just inserted into it — be contained BY it);
every other caller (the resize re-fit, `_moFlag`, `_moTabs`, the deferred-floor sampler) passes
none and still gets the full, unscoped sweep, so none of the six points above lost any coverage —
`r.target` (above, `grew`/`floorShrink`) is never excluded, since it already carries `data-fs-floor`
and is by construction one of the mutation's own targets. Measured live against the real fix,
same page, same 25s window: 725/625 down to 70/70 on the three routers above (a ~90% cut, `changed`
unmoved at 15 — nothing missed), and 80/75 down to 75/75 on `owrt2410`/`imm2410`, whose Overview
batches the same tick into a single callback rather than five, leaving little for a per-call skip
to find — not a regression, the unscoped-equivalent case this design already had to be safe under.
This is a COST fix, not a correctness one: the same probe that measured the churn found it does not
suppress the engine's own anchoring on any engine, and forcing every box "unchanged" by reading its
height WHILE ITS OLD FLOOR IS STILL APPLIED — `min-height` masks a real shrink the same way it masks
everything under the floor — was tried and rejected for exactly the danger this file exists to
guard against: `tools/floor-contract.mjs` gained a case that shrinks a floored box by half its
children (not empty — `EMPTY_TALLEST`/`AFTER` above already cover that) and reads the floor back
against what the box actually stands at; the masked check fails it outright (a real live cell:
`owrt2410`/`imm2410` overview, a table cut from 15 to 8 rows, floor stuck at 639px against a 339px
box, +300px of blank the theme would never take back), the mutation-scoped fix passes it (339px
against 339px, 0px), and `floor-contract`'s existing ACCURACY/RELEASE/switch/fold/depends cases are
unmoved on the full default sweep (175 floors, worst −1px, 0 findings).


## A witness that cannot see the box it is measuring


`observeContent()` hands `lateDrift()` a growth in pixels: the refilled container's height now,
against the `min-height` `holdFloor()` pinned it at before the tick. It found that container by
matching a mutation record whose **target itself** wore `data-fs-floor` — and `dom.content()`
refills the node it is handed, which is regularly a level or two inside the pinned box. Measured on
Overview (`webkit`/`owrtsnapb`, `../tmp/floorprobe.mjs`): of twelve nodes a poll refills there, one
sits inside a floored box without the mark and two have no floored ancestor at all.

For those the witness returned nothing and `grew` read 0. On its own that is survivable — the
element-based `drift` normally carries the correction. The failure needs both witnesses blind at
once, which is exactly what a fold landing ABOVE the growing block produces: `drift` reads 0 because
the reference never moved, `grew` reads 0 because the record's target was not the pinned box, and
`lateDrift()` concludes there is nothing to correct and writes nothing.

**That is why this file's own cell list read green here and red in CI for three runs.** On these
stands the fold lands below the growing block and `drift` alone is enough; CI's pages are shorter
and it lands above. Seven differences between the two were measured and ruled out first — host load
(`load average` 16.7 of 20), core count (`taskset -c 0-3`), one process against three stands, the
minified package installed the way CI installs it, a stand recreated from scratch, the WebKit build
(`webkit-2336` both sides), and all of them together on the full axis: 276 runs, no findings, every
time.

`closest(FLOORED)` is strictly wider than the match it replaces, so no tick that used to find a
witness can stop finding one. Two reads downstream move to the box with it — `_deferredFloor` and
`floorShrink` both took `r.target.style.minHeight`, unset on an inner node, and left behind would
have reported a shrink the size of the whole box.

`tools/scroll-anchor.mjs` now prints `growth witness: none | self | div#id@<pinned>` on the
never-came-back and corrected-late findings, so the next report of this shape says which of the two
witnesses was blind instead of leaving it to be inferred.


## The later batch must not win


`dom.content()` refills in two batches, empty then fill, and the observer delivers both.
`lateDrift()` arms on the first and drops the second (`if (_lateFrame) return`), which aims the
correction at the half-second in which the section does not exist. CI measured what that costs on
`webkit owrtsnap @1440 side compact overview`: `theme said: wrote--834` — the theme wrote minus 834
pixels for a refill that grew the page by 120, then had nothing left for the real one, which reads
from outside as `writes: []` inside the measuring window with the damage done just before it.

**The obvious fix is wrong and the measurement says so.** Cancelling the pending call and re-arming
with the later batch — one `cancelAnimationFrame`/`clearTimeout` and a re-arm — turned the sweep
from clean into **12 findings on the ordinary path**: `engine-anchoring on`, Overview, the reader
drifted 46px, 88px and 138px across real poll ticks at every density and both layouts, on
`owrt2512` and `owrtsnap` alike. A real tick delivers around twenty mutation records, not two, so
every arm is superseded by the next and the correction never fires at all. Reverted; the same
command reads 276 runs and no findings again, which is how the 12 were shown to be the fix's own.

Whatever closes the `-834` has to leave the twenty-record case alone. The distinguishing mark of
the batch that must not be armed on is not "there is a later one" — that cannot be known when the
decision is made — but that the batch is a REMOVAL: the section loses children and gains none, and
the box it hangs from does not grow. That is checkable at arming time and does not exist on a
poll tick's ordinary records.

**The discriminator as first shipped was too wide — cbcfd5d.** "Removed nodes, added none, the box
no taller" also describes REPEAT's pad removal between two refills, and that removal is exactly the
real shrink `floorShrink` exists to carry into `lateDrift()`. CI: `refill 2/3 left the reader -60px
off, corrected never`, chromium and firefox, `/admin/network/dhcp @390`, both stands — checked
locally on webkit only before the push. The guard now also requires `floorShrink <= 1`: the empty
half of a refill is held by its floor and shrinks nothing, a real shrink does not.


## Growth below the reader


`closest(FLOORED)` (task blindgrow, above) made the growth witness see refills one level inside a
floored box. Nothing asked where that box was. For a box that grows BELOW the reader, the reader's
reference correctly does not move — and `lateDrift()`'s blind-witness branch reads "the reference
did not move, the offset did not compensate, the box grew" as a blind witness and writes the whole
growth, throwing the reader up the page.

Measured with a deterministic probe (`../tmp/p1-below.mjs`: park at 30 % of the room, grow a floored
box entirely below the viewport by 120 px from one level inside it, wrap `scrollTo` and the
`scrollTop` setter with a call stack), firefox and chromium × engine on / DECLINES / OFF ×
`/admin/network/dhcp` and Overview:

| fs-fit.js | cells that moved the reader |
|---|---|
| 21c0417, before `closest()` | 0 of 12 |
| 0f298ef … 98375e0 | 8 of 12 — offset +120, reader −120, on and DECLINES; stack `settle()` → `writeOffset()` |
| the positional guard | 0 of 12, no theme write at all |

The guard counts growth only from a box whose top is above the reader's reference top: a box that
begins at or below the reference cannot move it. The rect is read beside the `offsetHeight` just
taken, on the same layout.

The sweep could not see it: HOLD grows content at the top of `#view`, SWAP and REPEAT refill a body
entirely above the viewport — 828 runs, all growth above the reader. `tools/scroll-anchor.mjs` gains
BELOW, red on the regression in 4 of 4 engine-on cells (`below -120px`) and green on the guard in 12
of 12.


## A correction waiting for a frame the page does not produce


On the still path `lateDrift()` took one frame after the mutation and asked for a second one to
settle in. Right after a refill a page can produce no frame for hundreds of milliseconds, and the
sweep's `longest frame gap` equalled the wait to the millisecond:

- firefox, `/admin/network/dhcp @390 top compact`, engine DECLINES — `frame +21, wait-frame +21,
  settle +261`, gap 240 ms ending at +261;
- webkit, `Overview @1440 side normal`, engine DECLINES — `frame +18, wait-frame +18, settle +181`,
  gap 163 ms ending at +181.

The correction itself was right (+120) and nothing cancelled it; it was late only by the frame it
waited for, and the frame the reader saw in between was the uncorrected one. The callback it waited
from IS a frame, and `seen` is read at its top — reading `scrollTop` forces the layout the engine's
own adjustment is applied in, so `compensated` still sees what the engine did. It now settles there
(`why('now')`); the still condition remains the motion sampler's over `SCROLL_IDLE`, and a page that
is moving, or has a reader's hand on it, still takes the 400 ms road.

Full axis on this change with the sweep's frame read below, three engines in parallel on three stand
sets (2156 s): chromium 276 runs, webkit 276, firefox 273 — no findings on any. Firefox's three
missing cells are `/admin/network/dhcp` reading `page too short to scroll` that run: the lease table's
height varies between runs, and at firefox's metrics it fell under the sweep's 600 px of room.


## The sweep read a frame before the theme's own


The same report shape then came from CI on HEAD, without the stall above: firefox `owrt2512 @390 top
normal`, engine DECLINES, `/admin/network/dhcp`, `the correction landed 2702ms after the refill` —
with `late trail: [armed+18 frame+19 wait-frame+19 settle+21 wrote-120+21]` and `longest frame gap:
2681ms ending at +2702ms`. The theme wrote at +21 ms. The sweep's frame loop is requested right after
the refill, before the theme's rAF (armed from the mutation record a microtask later), so its read at
the top of each callback saw the page BEFORE the theme's correction in that same frame and credited
the correction to the next frame — 16 ms of slack on a healthy runner, the whole stall on a starved
one. Nothing a reader could see was late.

SWAP and REPEAT now read the mark from a ResizeObserver re-observing the root every frame: its
notifications are delivered in the same rendering update after every rAF callback and before paint,
and `observe()` always delivers one — no DOM write, no size change. The read is credited to its
frame's own timestamp; a frame the observer skipped is read at the top of the next one and credited
to that later frame, so a miss can only make a correction look later. The cell line prints `painted
N/M`; the final frame is read directly, so a full read is `N-1/N`.

Red before accepted: an fs-fit.js forced onto the 400 ms road read 13 late findings of 13 on each of
chromium, firefox and webkit (`corrected 409-425ms` against `settle+403…418`); the stall build on the
same cells read 51 runs, no findings, `corrected 3-18ms`, `painted 55/56` throughout.

Kept as a negative result: one `refill 2/3 on the same section left the reader -60px off (engineTrusted
true, corrected never)` on chromium `owrtsnapb @390 side large` during a full axis on the stall build.
The same cell, 216 REPEAT runs on the stall build and 216 on HEAD without it: no finding either way —
not attributable to the stall change and not reproduced. REPEAT's finding now carries the same late
and anchor trails as SWAP's, so the next one names its exit.

## What the sweep itself could not see

**The sweep's own mark has to be a faithful proxy, and `position: sticky` is a way for it not to
be.** `markAt()` already refuses `#view` and `.cbi-section-descr` for the same underlying reason —
a candidate whose top cannot move the way the page around it moves makes `after.top - before.top`
answer a question that is not "did the reader move". A sticky element's top is a third such
candidate: pinned to its stuck offset for as long as it stays stuck, so a mark that lands on one
measures the stick state, not the reader. Task 0177 found this live rather than by inspection — a
run on `owrtsnap @1440 side compact` landed its mark on `th.th`, the sidebar's own sticky table
header (`theme/30-tables.css`), where `owrt2512` landed on `td.td` for the same page and point. It
did not fire there (`headerWasPinned=true, tableTop=-166`, moved 0 across every repeat), which is
why the finding itself needed no fix; the trap was that nothing made that true on purpose. A
synthetic sticky header reproduces the failure directly: `markAt()` without the guard read
`rect.top` as 0 on every growth from 0 to 120px, while a plain sibling at the same point moved with
the page — a mark there would pass however badly the theme failed. `markAt()` now walks each
candidate's ancestors up to `#view` and skips one with `position: sticky` anywhere in that chain,
the same "detect and reject" shape as the other two exclusions, in both copies of the function
(`HOLD` and `SWAP`) since both pick a mark the same way.

**A `clamped 0px` in CI cannot say, by itself, whether the engine declined to anchor or the mark
misreported — task 0178.** A finding reproduced 2 of 2 on CI and 0 of 3 locally, a full webkit sweep
included, and the printed line — `floor alone: clamped 0px, reader 120px` — has only one number
that could tell those two apart, and it was never printed: `after.pos - before.pos` for the swap,
the offset the scroller was actually asked to move by. A healthy floor-off pass shows the whole
120px of growth arriving there (the engine compensating for real); a pass where the engine simply
never engaged would print the same `clamped 0px` while this term stayed at 0 too. Both `swap()`
passes (corrected and floor-alone) now report it, printed beside the field it disambiguates rather
than added as a new field CI output has to be re-read to notice — `[offset +120]` next to `swap
moved 0px`, `[offset +120]` next to `reader 120px`. The anchor node's own identity (which element
`fs-fit.js` chose to hold the line, which is the other unverified half of the same CI-only report)
is not in this line: `fs-fit.js` remembers it in a private `_rest.el` and exports no accessor, so
reaching it costs an export this task did not add — recorded rather than reached.

**A cell can report `swap moved 0px` while measuring nothing, and that is worse than a wrong
number — task 0178.** `SWAP`'s body picker takes the tallest `.cbi-section > div` etc. entirely
above the reader; on the Overview that can land inside `.fs-ovl`, the grid `fs-overview.js` wraps
System/Memory/Storage in (`styles/pages/20-overview.css`). The grid sizes a row off its TALLER
column, so a shorter column can absorb the whole 120px pad without the row, and so the document,
growing by a pixel — measured live, `div#fs-ovl-panel-0` at 291px on `owrtsnap @900` and again on
`owrt2410 @1200`, `moved 0` both times, printed exactly like a correction working. The two are
distinguished the same way as the paragraph above: a real measurement grows the document by close
to the pad it inserted, so `swap()` now also reports `docH` before and after the refill, and a cell
where that delta comes back under half the pad folds into `swap.skip` — the same branch "nothing
above the reader big enough to collapse" already uses, printed as a named skip rather than silently
joining the pass line. A skip, not an error: the body picker choosing badly on one page shape is not
a theme fault, and failing the gate over it would be one more thing this file would have to explain
away on every future run of that cell.

**`HOLD` reporting `moved -505px` said nothing by itself — task latenet.** The finding was
`firefox owrt2512 @1440 top compact`, and it was chased for a full round without reproducing: 0 of
several local attempts came back with anything but a healthy read. The printed line — `reader moved
-505px` — carries no geometry, only the delta, so there was no way to tell "the correction failed"
from "the mark ended up somewhere that makes the delta read like a failure for an unrelated reason".
It turned out to be the second kind: `before.top` reads 503 on every local run, and a mark whose
`after.top` lands near 0 is the mark sitting at the viewport's own top — a real, different event from
a page moving under a still reader — not −503px of uncorrected drift. `HOLD` now returns `before` and
`after` in full, and the sweep prints both (`before.top=… after.top=…`) beside every `moved` value,
finding or not, so a reading like this one is legible without a follow-up session. It also carries
`writes`, the scroll-write log an `addInitScript` wrapper records for the whole context (wrapping
`scrollTo`, `scrollBy`, the `scrollTop` setter and `Element.scrollTo`, borrowed from
`../tmp/task-holdreg/hold-probe.mjs`), printed on a finding only — the log of who actually wrote the
scroll position, not just what it ended at. And because one flake in roughly 216 cells (the size of a
full three-engine sweep) must not fail a run on its own, a `HOLD` reading past `TOLERANCE` is
re-measured once, on the same page, before it is allowed to become a finding at all; only a reading
that reproduces on the second pass is reported, with both readings' geometry printed together.


## Two mechanisms measured and removed

**Two mechanisms were measured here and are no longer in the tree**, and their numbers are the
reason the revert stops where it does rather than an argument to put them back. `putBack()`
re-reading where the element landed: −52px on five passes out of five, 0px on five with it.
`settleDrift()`: −60px on 2 passes out of 7 against 0 out of 6 with it, **on `imm2410 @390 top
large`, webkit, and nowhere else** — a race a single pass cannot see, which took that cell (88
`min-height` writes and a 58px jump in the same frame) plus five repeats to catch, and which a
purpose-built assertion caught nothing of across four sweeps. **An optional stand is the only place
a mechanism of this theme is measurable**, which is worth knowing before `--only` is narrowed to the
core three. Both belong to the layer 0.14.7.1 removed: a correction that repairs another correction
is what the reports were about, and neither fault they answer has been reported since.



## A correction's own write reads as the reader moving

`lateDrift()` and `applyAnchor()` write `scrollTop` directly, the browser dispatches `scroll` for
that exactly as for a finger, and `noteMotion()` used to open a full `SCROLL_IDLE` (400ms) window for
either — which then blocks `holdFloor()`, `rememberRest()` and `applyAnchor()` itself, since all
three refuse while `scrolling()`.

**Measured** (`owrt2512b`/chromium/Overview, task refill2's own probe over `REPEAT`'s back-to-back
refills): a correction's write at t=6530 opened a motion window to t=6930 and the next refill's
mutation arrived at t=6811 — INSIDE it, and inside the 700ms gap the next refill starts in, where
such a write routinely lands. Both `holdFloor()` and `rememberRest()` were silently
refused for that refill, so the floor never picked up the new content's real height and `_rest` kept
describing the position from before it; the correction two ticks later measured a fabricated 59px
drift against that stale reference and wrote a real one. That is the 47-60px "never corrected" shape
the gate reports. Two such self-inflicted writes are two misses by `lateDrift()`'s own count, which
is what tripped `_engineTrusted` false in a run where the engine had anchored correctly throughout.

**The marker is not single-shot, and that half was measured separately.** `noteMotion()` (the
`scroll` event) and `sampleMotion()`'s own frame loop both ask about the SAME settling write when the
sampler was already running before it, and a version clearing `_ownWrite` on the first of the two to
ask left the second with nothing to recognise — reading an already-explained pixel as fresh motion
and re-extending `_movingUntil` right over the write's own settle. Live, `owrt2512b`/webkit/Overview
@390 top, 3/3 reps: `scrolling()` never came back false at all between refills,
`holdFloor()`/`rememberRest()` refused every one of them, and the reader drifted 59px on the second
and third with no correction ever landing — the same shape a stale `_rest` produces, from a different
cause. `_ownWrite` now clears only once the offset moves to something ELSE, so however many places
ask, the answer for that pixel stays consistent.

## The reference after this file's own write must be re-taken forced

A write moves the page by exactly the drift measured, so `_rest.top` still holds for that tick's own
element — but `_rest` itself was taken by `run()` at the top of the callback, before the mutation had
a settled height and before the engine had done any compensating of its own. Left standing, the NEXT
refill measures its drift against that mid-transition snapshot and computes a fabricated number: on
`REPEAT`'s back-to-back refills of one section this was the 59px "never corrected" drift itself, not
merely late bookkeeping.

**Forced, because an ordinary call is refused.** The engine's real compensation for the SAME mutation
settles inside the same `SCROLL_IDLE` window as this write, leaving `scrolling()` true by a handful
of milliseconds — measured, an unforced `rememberRest()` right after the write was refused on
`scrolling()` still reading true from the engine's own, unrelated scroll event **1ms** earlier.
Measured (`owrt2512b`/chromium/Overview): `moved 0, 0, -59` with an unforced
`rememberRest()` after the write against `moved 0, 0, 0` with `rememberRest(true)`, `trusted true`
throughout. `rememberRest(true)` is safe only for a caller that has just written the offset itself:
the write has already landed by the time the call happens, so there is no multi-step animation to
read mid-flight.

## A floor shrink is not evidence about the engine

Every `run()` clears and rewrites a floored box's `min-height`, and a WRITE to that property is a
scroll-anchor invalidation in its own right (css-scroll-anchoring-1 §2.2.2) — independent of how
reliably the engine otherwise keeps a reference. A floored box whose content really shrank pays that
cost on every engine, every time, structurally.

**Measured** (`owrt2512b`/chromium/Overview, `REPEAT`'s back-to-back refills): two ordinary shrinks
ten seconds apart read `trustedBefore true, trustedAfter false` on an engine that had anchored every
real growth on the same section at 0px throughout, with the reader never moving. So `floorShrink > 1`
skips the bookkeeping — the correction itself still runs, since neither reader-facing rule cares why
the engine left a residual. `settleDeferredFloor()`'s own write is excluded for the same reason.

## One pixel of direct drift is the same table rounding

The blind-witness branch only ever sees a table's row-rounding when the engine's own compensation
left `drift` under a pixel. On the SAME table's GROWTH refill the direct `drift` measured exactly 1px
against a 132px growth (`owrt2512b`/chromium, `/admin/network/dhcp @390`, side and top) — one pixel
over the `< 1` line, so neither guard caught it, and a write that small still counted as a miss.
`REPEAT`'s three-refill window turns that into two, and `_engineTrusted` tripped false on an engine
anchoring within a pixel every time. The direct drift is now read against the same
`LATE_ROUND_TOLERANCE` the blind branch already measured this page and width against (8-12.25px)
rather than against a second number for the same table.

## The last eight exits, with the clock

`lateDrift()` has eight ways to return without writing and `applyAnchor()` five, and from outside
they are one symptom: `writes: []`. Three CI runs were spent guessing between them — whether the
theme tried and missed, had no reference to try from, or read the engine as having already done the
job — and each guess cost a push. One short string set at every exit ends that: the finding names the
line instead of the silence.

**One last word is still ambiguous, which is why the last eight are kept with `performance.now()`
beside each.** A correction whose `settle` has not run yet and one that ran, exited and was re-armed
by a later mutation both read `armed` at the end of the sweep's window: seen on firefox,
`/admin/network/dhcp @390 top large`, engine on — `theme said: armed` with the correction landing at
1744 ms. The clock is the one the sweep measures the refill on, so the gate can print each entry
relative to it.

`applyAnchor()` carries the same trail for the same reason: the engine-OFF cell of
`/admin/network/dhcp @390 top compact` corrected at 1034 ms and 1885 ms on firefox with `theme said:
null`, i.e. through that path and not `lateDrift()`, and five of its exits read as "late" from
outside.

## A tap is not motion

`touchstart` used to feed `noteMotion()` as well as `noteIntent()`, so a stationary tap on a tab
declared the page moving for `SCROLL_IDLE` (400ms) and gated `fitChrome()` with it: the freshly drawn
tab strip painted at full padding and only shrank once the sampler saw the page still, ~400 ms after
the tap. Feeding `mousedown` and `keydown` to `noteMotion()` has the same shape one level worse —
`scrolling()` would answer yes for 400ms after any click and every keystroke, and while typing into a
form 9 of 10 layout-reading passes were skipped and landed in one burst afterwards.

Real motion is read from the scroll POSITION by `sampleMotion()`, not from the event: `touchmove`,
`wheel`, `scroll` and momentum all still start it, so nothing that actually moves the page loses its
guard, and a scrollbar drag or a Page Down moves the page and says so itself through `scroll`.
`touchstart`/`mousedown`/`keydown` answer one question only — is the reader present — which is what
`lateDrift()` needs and what `scrolling()` must not be told.

## Width only: the URL bar is a resize

Every browser on iOS grows and shrinks the viewport HEIGHT while the reader scrolls, because the URL
bar slides away, and each step is a resize the `ResizeObserver` reports. Simulated on a 390px
viewport, twenty height-only steps had the fitters rewrite **1054 class attributes**, each a forced
layout of a page the reader is scrolling.

Nothing a fitter asks is about height, and the apparent counter-example is not one: a vertical
scrollbar appearing takes WIDTH from the content box. The width is compared per element, since the
roots are observed separately and a dialog can resize while `#view` does not, and `contentRect` is
read rather than `getBoundingClientRect()` — the observer has already measured it, and asking again
inside the callback is the forced layout the coalescing exists to avoid.

## Which element scrolls, asked once per width

The question is "which element does this LAYOUT scroll", not "does this element overflow". The
latter is a property of the content and cannot be memoised against a width stamp: a short page caches
"the window scrolls", and after navigating to a tall one every pass reads `window.scrollY`, which the
sidebar layout pins at 0 — so no mid-scroll guard in the file ever fires again.

The stylesheet decides it (`theme/20-shell.css` gives `.fs-main` `overflow-y: auto` in the desktop
sidebar layout only), so the computed value is the answer and it is correct the moment the CSS
changes. `getComputedStyle` resolves style, not layout; the verdict is cached against the resize
stamp and the two attributes that carry a layout change, because this runs in the frame loop for as
long as the page moves and a `scrollHeight`/`clientHeight` probe there would be a forced layout per
frame in the middle of a flick.

## The reference must survive the tick

`dom.content()` replaces a section's children, so the element the hit test landed on is usually gone
by the time the correction runs. Four measurements shape what happens then:

- **A fresh reference is not a substitute.** On 24.10, with only a fresh one to take, its drift was
  refused by the ceiling and the reader stayed **1206px** from where they had been.
- **The section around it is.** Where the tick also grew the page nothing was clamped, so the "give
  back what the engine took" path had no number either and a fresh reference measured a drift of
  zero: the page moved **136px** under the reader (engine anchoring suppressed). What survives is the
  frame — `.cbi-section`, `.cbi-map` or `.fs-ovl` — since the stock poll refreshes it in place.
- **A clamp is a receipt, and the ceiling is raised by exactly it.** `applyAnchor()` refuses a
  correction bigger than a viewport plus 200px, since a drift that size usually means the view
  replaced its whole subtree; without `slack` the worst clamps (**690px in a 300px viewport**) are
  the ones refused. In WebKit with its own anchoring off, one tick clamped the offset by 130px while
  the page moved 255px.
- **A page at the top does not pay for a reference.** At offset 0 there is nothing to lose, and
  `anchorRef()`'s hit test plus rect costs 0.2ms typical, **6ms on a poll-dirtied WebKit layout**.
  The offset is still remembered: `anchorFor()`'s clamp test is written in terms of it.

The hit test itself is a search rather than a single probe. `#view` answers wherever the point lands
in a gap and its own top never moves, and a point above the first section answers with `.fs-content`,
outside the host — so the whole stack at the point is taken and, failing that, the probe steps down
the viewport up to five times.

## No correction for a batch put off through a flick

A pass refused while the reader was moving runs once the page is still, and it runs WITHOUT a
correction. Both available references are wrong for a page the reader has just scrolled through: a
fresh one is read against an offset WebKit may not have laid out yet, so the theme undoes the
reader's own move, and the one from the last still page drags them back to where they were before the
flick. The gate caught that as a **231px jump landing inside a scroll, on all three engines**.

Nothing in that batch is a poll tick — the fitters re-measure what the scroll already showed rather
than growing the page — and the next mutation corrects against a reference taken while the page was
still.

## The arm belongs to the disarm

`theme/30-tables.css` keeps a data table out of the layout until something marks it `.fs-fitted`, and
only `fs-select.js` ever writes that mark — a module the footer requires separately, with no
dependency edge from `fs-fit.js`. Arming the rule at module eval therefore left every data table
invisible in any document where `fs-select.js` failed to load. The arming is exported instead, so the
module that clears the rule is the one that raises it, and a fitter that throws on its first run is
caught at registration rather than propagating out of `init()` and leaving every later registration
unmade.

## A floor on a table box holds nothing

`min-height` is undefined on a table box (CSS 2.1 §10.7) and WebKit acts on that: a `.table` wearing
a **313px** floor still collapsed to **30px** when its rows went, and the document lost **284px** on
/admin/network/firewall. Chromium held the 313px, which is why the shape reads as an engine
difference until the spec line is read. The floor therefore climbs to the first box that is not a
table, where the same emptied table costs 0px on both engines.

Reported from an iPhone as the Overview sinking a little every five seconds: LuCI's poll takes the
whole `table.table` out of the first card and puts a new one back — measured on the stand, once per
`pollinterval`, **482px** — and between the two the section is empty. On WebKit the floor on the
table held nothing, the offset was clamped into a document that short, and the reader was left
further down the page than they had been.

## A synthetic collapse probe calls every engine broken

Whether an engine cleans up after a container refill cannot be feature-tested. WebKit shipped
`overflow-anchor`, so every engine claims the property, and a probe that performs the collapse
itself measures something a real page never does: a real poll puts layout and a frame between the
collapse and the refill, and the synthetic version cost **Chromium and Firefox 15px of drift they
did not have**. The offset cannot answer it either — after a refill it comes back LARGER, not
smaller.

So nothing is assumed: the element the reader was looking at is asked where it is now, two frames
after the mutation, once the engine has finished its own correction. Chromium lands where it
started; an older WebKit overshoots — a section growing **120px** moved the offset by **180px**, so
the reader creeps up the page on every tick — and an engine that got it right reports zero drift and
the theme does nothing.

## Still, not equal to the reference

`lateDrift()` refuses to write into a page whose offset has moved since the reference was taken, and
"moved" has to mean moved SINCE, not "differs from the reference". An anchoring engine moves the
offset ITSELF to keep the reader over content that grew: measured on webkit/Overview, **+658px of
offset against 600px of growth**. Refusing on a difference from the reference would leave the
engine's own residual — **58px** on that tick — uncorrected, which is the whole reason this path
exists. The check is `scrollTop() !== seen`: the offset read twice, once at the top of the frame and
once at the settle.

## Where the engine anchors, an immediate correction undoes the reader's own scroll

The mutation observer takes the engine-off correction only where `_engineTrusted` is false, and the
measurement is why. Written unconditionally, the correction reads its reference in the same instant
the poll mutated the page, and after a scroll WebKit hands back the new `scrollTop` before the layout
that goes with it — so the drift measures the reader's own move and the correction undoes it: **the
page went back to 0 from 591 on every run**.

A residual check two frames later was carried for that engine and is gone with the floor moving from
the column to the containers: the collapse it answered no longer happens, and its own correction
landed inside a flick (**161px**, webkit/Overview, `tools/scroll-anchor.mjs`).
