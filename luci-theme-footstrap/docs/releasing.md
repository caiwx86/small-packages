# Releasing

The mandatory pre-release checklist, the changelog contract, and the runbook. **No release goes out
until the automatic gates are green and the live checks are done for every issue the release diff
touches.**

How CI builds and signs the packages: [ci.md](ci.md).

## Why there is a checklist at all

Every closed bug left a guard behind — a gate or a live check that catches its return. This page
is the register: one row per issue, the mechanism, the command, and whether it is automated.

A bug with no guard comes back silently. **If you fix something that has no row here, add a row.**

## Step 1 — scope: what can regress in this release

A regression can only come from what the diff touches.

```sh
git status --short | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's#/.*##' | sort -u
git status --short | grep -E 'styles/|menu-footstrap|\.ut$|fs-sheets|fs-select|fs-fit' \
  || echo 'no CSS / renderer / template / fence changes'
```

- The diff does not touch `styles/`, the renderer, the templates or the fence → the visual and
  fence issues (#1–#5, #7–#11) cannot regress from it. Their gates being green is enough; a live run
  is allowed but not required.
- The diff touches the matching area → the live check for those issues is mandatory.

**Always mandatory regardless of the diff:** the whole automatic section, plus issue #6 (packaging
and asset selection) — because #6 breaks at the release level rather than in the code, and
nothing fails until a router in the field pulls the update.

## Step 2 — the automatic gates

One run closes most of the guards. It must exit 0.

```sh
npm run check
```

| Issue | What went wrong | The guard inside `check` |
|---|---|---|
| #3, #8 | theme styles stopped applying on a foreign package's page (filemanager, OpenClash `*{padding:0!important}`) | `chrome-fence` — the fence/pin/dark-guard still match the chrome; `fs-sheets` re-hosts the foreign sheet |
| #5 | the `low`/`medium`/`high` ramp was three aliases of one colour, so "no data" lit up like a live value | `export-tier` (three DIFFERENT colours), `audit --strict` |
| forum 82-83 | the `placeholder` attribute and the unset dropdown row were drawn in the body inks, so an option's DEFAULT read as a value the reader had typed | `placeholder-ink` (a hint is ≥40% light / ≥30% dark of the ink-to-field range away from the value, and still 3:1, with every combination re-run under `prefers-contrast: more`) |
| #6 | localisation as separate `luci-i18n-*` packages, so the self-update script shipped at the time pulled a catalogue instead of the theme | `i18n` (catalogue current and complete); `tools/check-packages.sh` asserts exactly one theme package per format, but runs in CI's build job rather than inside `check` |
| #9, #11 | config-table row labels and a data-table column vanished or were squeezed | `css-dup` + `mirror` (`@mirror table-card/*`) |
| all | a rule lost its `!important` or started depending on source order | `css-metrics`, `audit --strict`, `css-orphans` |
| — | the template pre-paint drifted from the live appearance appliers | `axes` |
| — | `[Unreleased]` without a bold lead, or the RU mirror out of sync → an empty release note | `changelog` |

`tools/jsmin-verify.mjs` is not in `check` (it needs a jsmin binary built from the pin) — CI runs
it. Locally the cause is covered by eslint's `wrap-regex`, inside `lint`.

`/security-review` runs beside it, on the diff this release carries, before the tag. It is not a
gate and cannot be — it reads a diff rather than a tree — which is why it is named here instead:
the pass is worth the minute on the five things a theme can actually get wrong (the installer's
signature chain, new shell running over a build tree, the unauthenticated login template, sinks in
the browser JS, the packaging pipeline), and a maintainer has asked outright whether one was done.

## Step 3 — asset selection (issue #6), separately and always

This is the most fragile part of every release and the only one that fails silently: the release
notes and the asset choice are evaluated at tag time, in the field, months later.

- **The CI gate** (`build` job): exactly N assets per format, each package resolving through its own
  **name-anchored** regex `^<name>[-_][^/]*\.EXT$` to exactly one. A `.sig` ends in `.EXT.sig` and
  does not match `\.EXT$`.
- **The reader in the field** is `install.sh`, and it never guesses: on a router the feed cannot
  serve it reads the signed `manifest.txt` and matches `$2` against the package name exactly, which
  is what makes a release carrying `luci-theme-footstrap` and two `luci-i18n-footstrap-<lang>`
  packages safe where #6 was not. The release must still resolve to one file per format **per
  name**, for a by-hand install and for the Pages mirror. Simulate it against the shape of the
  coming release:

```sh
# on a dev router, RELJSON = the release JSON of the intended shape
for EXT in apk ipk; do
  n=$(jsonfilter -i "$RELJSON" -e '@.assets[*].browser_download_url' \
      | grep -Ec "/luci-theme-footstrap[-_][^/]*\.$EXT\$")
  echo "$EXT -> n=$n (must be 0 or 1)"
done
```

## Step 4 — live checks for the areas the diff touched

Run on both releases (25.12/apk and 24.10/opkg). Compare against stock bootstrap
wherever you are unsure — it is the reference for LuCI behaviour.

**A release runs the WIDE version of the automatic live gates first:**

**and `npm run live -- …` cannot carry those flags**: `live` is six `npm run` calls joined by `&&`,
and npm appends the arguments after the LAST of them, so `--all --pages-all` reached `anchor` alone
and every gate before it ran its default set. Measured on 2026-09-01: the composed line the shell
echoes ends `… && npm run anchor --all --pages-all`, and `live-audit` logged
`node tools/live-audit.mjs` with no arguments. Each gate is therefore called by hand:

```sh
node tools/live-audit.mjs  --all --pages-all   # every OpenWrt router owlab boots, every page
node tools/spa-parity.mjs  --all --pages-all
node tools/table-tick.mjs  --all
node tools/scroll-anchor.mjs --all
node tools/upstream-contract.mjs --all         # what the theme assumes of luci-base, asked on each
```

**And the package on both formats, before the tag.** `npm run live` measures a *synced* tree; a
release is *installed*, and that is a different claim — two `owlab test` invocations, one per
format, never one run with two `--release` flags (`--install` is a host-side glob evaluated per
router, so `dist/*/…` hands the apk box an ipk too: `0 of 2 routers passed`). The five assertions
and the exact flags are in [development.md](development.md#proving-it-on-a-router-owlab-test); the
fifth is the `ucode -T -c` sweep over every installed template.

```sh
./tools/stage.sh && owfeed build
owlab test --release 25.12.4 --install 'dist/noarch/luci-theme-footstrap-*.apk' --assert …
owlab test --release 24.10.8 --install 'dist/all/luci-theme-footstrap_*.ipk'   --assert …
```

Both of these are long runs: start them detached with `tools/bg.sh` and read the logs out of
`../tmp/`. **A release is not cut until every log above has been read** — a detached run nobody
opened is not a green gate, and the tier a check sits in never changes what the release requires.

**23.05 used to have a line of its own here, and no longer does.** It was the oldest release the
theme claimed and the only one whose `luci-base` was missing a widget the theme uses:
`ui.RangeSlider` arrived in 24.10, and its absence took the ENTIRE Appearance tab down — the panel
is built inside one try/catch, so the miss cost a console line and an empty tab, reported from the
field by a user on 23.05.5 rather than by a gate. Support for that release ended at 0.14.2: it is
EOL, and openwrt/luci declined to carry the compatibility code in the tree the theme now lives in
(#8978). `install.sh` pins that version for a 23.05 router and says it is the last one; the stand
and the contract entry that guarded it are gone with the fallback they guarded.

Day to day those gates measure three routers and one page per shape, which is what makes them cheap
enough to run before a push (`docs/development.md`). A release is the one moment where the axes they
trade away are worth paying for: a page that shares a shape with another is only *probably* the same
to this theme. Read the reduction lines either way — they name every page that was stood in for.
ImmortalWrt is not measured by any gate (`tools/lib/stands.mjs`).

| Issue | Page | What to look at |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | a third-party app with a wide table, firewall zones | the table stacks into cards, does not overflow its section; the content width does not tear |
| #2 | Podkop → Monitoring, any `<select>` | the dropdown opens, host filtering works |
| #7 | `admin/system/package-manager` | the theme's favicon; buttons do not overlap the inputs; no stray unrounded table border |
| #9 | `admin/network/firewall/forwards`, `/snats` (GridSection) | config-table row labels visible (`.fs-stacked` cards / `@container 960`) |
| #10 | `admin/network/dhcp` (a page with hidden tabs) | no empty scroll below the content |
| #41, #75 | `admin/network/network`, `admin/system/startup` (a page with a tab strip) | switch tabs: the pane the reader LEFT keeps no `min-height`, and the tab they opened starts where the page starts. `floor-contract` asks it automatically — it clicks the strip and reads the inactive panes — because the fault is invisible on a page that is only loaded and, on a page that does not poll, never goes away by itself |
| the iPhone report | `admin/status/overview` on a narrow window, scrolled off the top | the page does not creep upward once per poll tick. `fit-quiet` asks the cause automatically — the bar may not be shorter than it settled at while it measures itself — because the symptom needs an engine with no scroll anchoring and does not reproduce headless |
| #11 | `admin/status/overview` (client list) | the "Network" column is not crushed, rows are not over-wide |
| #17 | the release assets, not a page | `manifest.txt` **and** `manifest.txt.sig` are present; `latest/download/manifest.txt` serves that file; `usign -V` passes with `release.pub`; `awk '$1=="pkg"'` yields one line per format; no install or update path touches `api.github.com`. **The manifest is now load-bearing for installs**, not only for readers: a router the feed cannot serve is installed from it (`install.sh` -> `install_from_release`), so a manifest that does not verify is an install that refuses |

**Why #17 is here and not "CI will catch it".** CI does check it (the `release` job compares the
served `latest/download/manifest.txt` against the built one), but a manifest failure is **invisible
on the page**: the theme looks fine while installation breaks for new users and the update badge
breaks for existing ones — on someone else's router, weeks later. That is exactly the failure shape
this file exists for.

## The changelog contract

The single source of truth for `CHANGELOG.md` and its Russian mirror `CHANGELOG_ru.md`.

**`npm run changelog` holds the mechanical half**: the set, order and uniqueness of sections, empty
sections, dates, `compare` links, mirror parity (versions, dates, sections, bullet count) and the
mandatory bold lead on `[Unreleased]` and a freshly cut version. It exists because `[Unreleased]`
once accumulated a **duplicate `### Changed`** over several commits: each commit looked fine on its
own, and `release-notes.sh` would have printed two "Changed" groups on the release page with nothing
failing, because the notes are generated at tag time, when the tag is already pushed.

**Everything about the prose below, the gate cannot check.** That part is on you.

### What we chose

- **Base: Keep a Changelog 1.1.0.** Fixed category names and order, `[Unreleased]` on top, newest
  version first, ISO 8601 dates, the file at the repository root.
- **Extension: `Performance`** — a seventh category on top of KaC's six. A documented, legitimate
  extension.
- **Voice: effect-lead** — neither strictly past tense nor strictly imperative:
  `- **one-line effect.** then the reasoning`. A third option, but internally consistent; keep it
  everywhere.
- **Commits follow Conventional Commits** (so the version bump can be derived), but the changelog is
  **written by hand**. Generation from commits yields raw material only.

There are two competing standards and they disagree in three places — the category set, the verb
tense, and whether `[Unreleased]` should exist at all. **This project has already picked Keep a
Changelog on all three.** Do not "correct" entries toward the other standard.

### Categories, in this fixed order

`Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`, `Performance`.

- **One section of each type per release.** Two `### Fixed` under one version is a merge artefact.
- **The order does not follow the order the work was done in.**
- **No empty sections.** No bullets, no heading.
- Not all seven need to be present. A normal release is `Added`/`Changed`/`Fixed`, sometimes
  `Performance`.

### The shape of an entry

```
- **A one-line effect that reads on its own.** Then the reasoning: why, the measurement,
  what the rule protects against.
```

- **The bold lead IS the release note.** `tools/release-notes.sh` extracts only the bold lead of
  each bullet and groups it by section. So: the lead is mandatory (a bullet without `**…**` silently
  drops out of the release), and it must be a self-contained sentence, because it appears without
  the reasoning behind it.
- **Write the effect, not the diff.** "Buttons had no focus indicator at all" beats "changed
  `:hover` to `:focus` in `styles/base/70-buttons.css`".
- **Keep the number the change was made for.** "20 KB of font for 227 labels", "312 of 336 elements
  recoloured by a hostile `:root`", "1.69:1 where AA wants 4.5" — the measurement is the difference
  between a changelog and a marketing blurb.
- **Name what the rule protects against** if it is not obvious. Half this theme's invariants exist
  because the obvious alternative was tried and was worse; an entry without the reason invites the
  next person to undo it.
- **Do not cite commits** or retell a file's history. A changelog is not a git log.
- **Edit the existing entry; do not append a second one.**
- **Merge related commits into one entry.**

### `[Unreleased]`

**Every substantive commit writes into `## [Unreleased]` in the same commit as the code.** A
changelog written afterwards is written from the diff, and the diff is precisely what does not know
why. Commits that change nothing for a user or a maintainer (a typo in a comment, a CI-only
refactor) need no entry; when in doubt, write one.

### The bilingual mirror

`CHANGELOG.md` (English) and `CHANGELOG_ru.md` are **edited in one commit**. A mirror that lags is
worse than no mirror: the reader cannot tell which copy is stale. Same section set and order, same
numbers, versions and `compare` links — only the prose may differ, never the facts. The English file
is the primary source for the release-note generator.

### Anti-patterns

A dump of the commit log or the diff; copying a commit or PR verbatim; a partial changelog that
omits `Removed`/`Security`/breaking changes; duplicate sections under one version; an entry written
from the diff after the fact; a self-reference to a commit hash.

## The runbook

Only after everything above has passed:

1. Rename `[Unreleased]` to `## [x.y.z] — YYYY-MM-DD` in both `CHANGELOG.md` and
   `CHANGELOG_ru.md`, and add the `compare/` link at the bottom of each. Sections in the canonical
   order, every bullet with a `bold lead`.
2. `npm run changelog` — green.
3. Commit that change. Message in English, Conventional Commits, **no AI attribution**.
4. Tag `vx.y.z` on this commit. **Never tag first** — the tag must point at a commit that
   already contains its own entry, or the release describes a version whose changelog does not yet
   exist.
5. **Before pushing, read the recent runs on `main`**: `gh run list --limit 6` — on the maintainer's
   Windows machine `gh` is not on `PATH` in Git Bash or WSL, and must be called by its full path,
   `"/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe" run list --limit 6`. A run already red before your push
   stays red after it, and `release` does not fire until whatever it currently gates on is green —
   so a tag pushed onto a broken pipeline cannot publish. A pre-existing failure is not something to
   push past: it is either an infrastructure condition to be fixed first, or a real regression that
   has nothing to do with this release but will still hold it. `v0.14.12` was tagged onto exactly
   this: the previous commit on `main` had already failed the same way the day before, on the same
   upstream condition, and nobody looked before the tag went out.
6. Push the commit and the tag to `origin` — the only remote (the `git.vaka.work` mirror was removed
   on 2026-07-25).
7. CI on `v*` builds both formats, signs them, and builds the release body from the changelog, but
   `release` does not run until whatever it gates on is green, by design — deliberately, so that a
   tag cannot publish a package no router has installed. The consequence is exactly what bit
   `v0.14.12`: any one red leg holds the whole release, including a leg red for a reason that has
   nothing to do with the diff — infrastructure or an upstream feed, not this release's code. **The
   release is not cut until the tag's own run is read, job by job, not merely waited on**: `gh run
   view <id>` for the job list, `gh run view --job <id> --log-failed` for the failing step's log; say
   plainly whether the cause is this diff, an infrastructure condition, or an upstream feed. Only
   then check the release carries the expected assets (plus a `.sig` for each): the theme resolving
   to exactly one asset per format, the manifest, the installer, the notes.
8. **Publish the feed, and do not trust the bot to finish it.** The theme is installed from
   owfeed-packages, so a release nobody can `apk upgrade` into is half a release. The hourly job
   there opens the version-bump pull request and says it "will merge itself once the checks pass".
   Measured on 0.14.10, it does neither on its own, and both halves are mechanical:
   - its pull request is authored by `app/github-actions`, and that repository's
     `fork-pr-contributor-approval` policy holds the `pull_request` check run in `action_required`
     until a person approves it. The job dispatches its own run of the same workflow, which goes
     green, but the automerge waits on the held one. **Approve it** (`gh api -X POST
     repos/owfeed/owfeed-packages/actions/runs/<id>/approve`), or the PR sits open with a green
     check beside it.
   - after the merge, `Publish` does not start: it triggers on a push to `main`, and a push made
     with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger workflows. **Dispatch it by hand**
     (`gh workflow run publish.yml --repo owfeed/owfeed-packages`).

   Then read the **served** index rather than the workflow log — `apk adbdump` on
   `releases/25.12/<arch>/packages.adb`, `Packages.gz` on `releases/24.10/<arch>/` — and confirm the
   new version is there. Tracked as [owfeed-packages#53](https://github.com/owfeed/owfeed-packages/issues/53);
   when that is fixed, this step goes back to being one sentence.

A fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` comes back on top with the next substantive commit.
